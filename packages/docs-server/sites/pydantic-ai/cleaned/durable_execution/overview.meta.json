  "description": "Pydantic AI allows you to build durable agents that can preserve their progress across transient API failures and application errors or restarts, and handle long-running, asynchronous, and human-in-the-loop workflows with production-grade reliability. Durable agents have full support for [streaming](../../agents/#streaming-all-events) and [MCP](../../mcp/client/), with the added benefit of fault tolerance."
