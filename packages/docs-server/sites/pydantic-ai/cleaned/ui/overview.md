# UI Event Streams
If you're building a chat app or other interactive frontend for an AI agent, your backend will need to receive agent run input (like a chat message or complete [message history](../../message-history/)) from the frontend, and will need to stream the [agent's events](../../agents/#streaming-all-events) (like text, thinking, and tool calls) to the frontend so that the user knows what's happening in real time.
While your frontend could use Pydantic AI's [`ModelRequest`](../../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest) and [`AgentStreamEvent`](../../api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.AgentStreamEvent) directly, you'll typically want to use a UI event stream protocol that's natively supported by your frontend framework.
Pydantic AI natively supports two UI event stream protocols:
 * [Agent-User Interaction (AG-UI) Protocol](../ag-ui/)
 * [Vercel AI Data Stream Protocol](../vercel-ai/)
These integrations are implemented as subclasses of the abstract [`UIAdapter`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter) class, so they also serve as a reference for integrating with other UI event stream protocols.
## Usage
The protocol-specific [`UIAdapter`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter) subclass (i.e. [`AGUIAdapter`](../../api/ui/ag_ui/#pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter) or [`VercelAIAdapter`](../../api/ui/vercel_ai/#pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter)) is responsible for transforming agent run input received from the frontend into arguments for [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../../agents/#running-agents), running the agent, and then transforming Pydantic AI events into protocol-specific events. The event stream transformation is handled by a protocol-specific [`UIEventStream`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIEventStream) subclass, but you typically won't use this directly.
If you're using a Starlette-based web framework like FastAPI, you can use the [`UIAdapter.dispatch_request()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.dispatch_request) class method from an endpoint function to directly handle a request and return a streaming response of protocol-specific events. This is demonstrated in the next section.
If you're using a web framework not based on Starlette (e.g. Django or Flask) or need fine-grained control over the input or output, you can create a `UIAdapter` instance and directly use its methods. This is demonstrated in "Advanced Usage" section below.
### Usage with Starlette/FastAPI
Besides the request, [`UIAdapter.dispatch_request()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.dispatch_request) takes the agent, the same optional arguments as [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../../agents/#running-agents), and an optional `on_complete` callback function that receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`](../../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult) and can optionally yield additional protocol-specific events.
Note
These examples use the `VercelAIAdapter`, but the same patterns apply to all `UIAdapter` subclasses.
dispatch_request.py```
fromfastapiimport FastAPI
fromstarlette.requestsimport Request
fromstarlette.responsesimport Response
frompydantic_aiimport Agent
frompydantic_ai.ui.vercel_aiimport VercelAIAdapter
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5')
app = FastAPI()
@app.post('/chat')
async defchat(request: Request) -> Response:
 return await VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request(request, agent=agent)
```
### Advanced Usage
If you're using a web framework not based on Starlette (e.g. Django or Flask) or need fine-grained control over the input or output, you can create a `UIAdapter` instance and directly use its methods, which can be chained to accomplish the same thing as the `UIAdapter.dispatch_request()` class method shown above:
 1. The [`UIAdapter.build_run_input()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.build_run_input) class method takes the request body as bytes and returns a protocol-specific run input object, which you can then pass to the [`UIAdapter()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter) constructor along with the agent.
 * You can also use the [`UIAdapter.from_request()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.from_request) class method to build an adapter directly from a Starlette/FastAPI request.
 2. The [`UIAdapter.run_stream()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.run_stream) method runs the agent and returns a stream of protocol-specific events. It supports the same optional arguments as [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../../agents/#running-agents) and an optional `on_complete` callback function that receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`](../../api/agent/#pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult) and can optionally yield additional protocol-specific events.
 * You can also use [`UIAdapter.run_stream_native()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.run_stream_native) to run the agent and return a stream of Pydantic AI events instead, which can then be transformed into protocol-specific events using [`UIAdapter.transform_stream()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.transform_stream).
 3. The [`UIAdapter.encode_stream()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.encode_stream) method encodes the stream of protocol-specific events as SSE (HTTP Server-Sent Events) strings, which you can then return as a streaming response.
 * You can also use [`UIAdapter.streaming_response()`](../../api/ui/base/#pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.streaming_response) to generate a Starlette/FastAPI streaming response directly from the protocol-specific event stream returned by `run_stream()`.
Note
This example uses FastAPI, but can be modified to work with any web framework.
