# Getting Help
If you need help getting started with Pydantic AI or with advanced usage, the following sources may be useful.
Join the `#pydantic-ai` channel in the [Pydantic Slack](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/join-slack/) to ask questions, get help, and chat about Pydantic AI. There's also channels for Pydantic, Logfire, and FastUI.
If you're on a [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) Pro plan, you can also get a dedicated private slack collab channel with us.
The [Pydantic AI GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues) are a great place to ask questions and give us feedback.
