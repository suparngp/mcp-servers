How to access it
 * From the [Command Palette](/terminal/command-palette), type in "Autosuggestions" to toggle.
**Terminal Tip**
You can change the keybinding for accepting autosuggestions to `Tab`. Configure this in the "Tab key behavior" setting under Features > Editor. _Note: This will update the keybinding for opening the completions menu to_` _CTRL-SPACE_`_. You can also enable the "Open completions menu as you type" in Settings > Features so that the completions menu opens automatically._

There are several ways to accept autosuggestions, either completely or partially:
 * Complete an autosuggestion using the `RIGHT` arrow or `CTRL-F`.
 * `CTRL-E` also, completes the autosuggestion when your cursor is at the end of the buffer.
 * `CTRL-RIGHT` can be used to partially complete the autosuggestion one component at a time.

 * Complete an autosuggestion using the `RIGHT` arrow or `CTRL-F`.
