Customizing Warp's appearance
Warp has many [Appearance](/terminal/appearance) settings you can configure:
 * [**Themes**](https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/themes): You can choose from pre-loaded themes or create your own [custom theme](https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/custom-themes), using .yaml or based on a background image you upload.
 * **Input format** : Choose between Warp's Standard input or Classic input. Standard enables easier access to AI features, while Classic resembles a traditional terminal input more closely.
 * [**Text and fonts**](https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/text-fonts-cursor): You can customize your font type and font size. You can also adjust the font to improve readability and accessibility.
 * [**Input position**](https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/input-position): Set your prompt and command line to the top or bottom of your Warp window.
Navigate to `Settings > Appearance` to customize your setup.
### 
[](#modify-behavior-settings)
Modify behavior settings
There are a number of behavior settings and features that will help you customize Warp to best suit your needs:
 * [Dedicated window](https://docs.warp.dev/features/windows/global-hotkey#dedicated-window): Dedicated hotkey window (also known as Quake Mode) allows you to customize your window's position, width, and height ratio relative to your active screen size.
 * [Tabs](/terminal/windows/tabs): Organize your windows into multiple sessions, and customize them with different titles and/or colors.
 * [Split panes](https://docs.warp.dev/features/windows/split-panes): Divide any tab into multiple panels, side-by-side or stacked.

Organize tabs and divide them into multiple panels
 * [Auto suggestions](https://docs.warp.dev/features/command-completions/autosuggestions): As you type, Warp will automatically suggest commands based on shell history and possible completions.
 * [Completions](https://docs.warp.dev/features/command-completions/completions): When you press TAB, Warp will suggest commands, option names, and path parameters for you. Customize your TAB key behavior under `Settings > Features`.
 * [Vim keybindings](https://docs.warp.dev/features/editor/vim): Warp supports default Vim keybindings, allowing for keyboard-driven text editing.
 * [Keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.warp.dev/features/keyboard-shortcuts): Warp supports commonly used keyboard shortcuts. You can also set custom keyboard shortcuts by creating new commands or editing existing shortcuts.
 * [Open files and links](https://docs.warp.dev/features/files-and-links): Using your cursor, you can open files, folders, and URL links that are within Blocks. You can also [configure the default editor to open files](https://docs.warp.dev/features/files-and-links#files-and-links-1).
 * [Command Corrections](/terminal/entry/command-corrections): Get auto-correct suggestions on commands to catch typos, forgotten flags, and general console errors.
