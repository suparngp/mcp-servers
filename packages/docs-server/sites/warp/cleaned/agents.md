AI in Warp
Warp includes intelligent agents designed to help you build, test, deploy, and debug while keeping you in control. Agents can look up commands, execute tasks, fix bugs, and adapt to your workflows. You can manage agent behavior directly, with full context from your Warp Drive and your team.
Warp's AI features can be globally disabled in `Settings > AI` with the AI toggle. These features sends input data to various LLM providers through their API. Warp is **SOC 2 compliant** and has **Zero Data Retention** policies with all contracted LLM providers -- no customer AI data is retained, store, or used for training. Read more about data privacy for Warp features [on our privacy page](https://www.warp.dev/privacy).

[](#included-agent-features)
Included Agent features:
 * [Agents](/agents/using-agents) - Run and manage multiple agents natively in Warp using natural language.
 * [Agent Conversations](/agents/using-agents/agent-conversations) - Warp organizes your AI interactions into conversations tied to sessions, allowing you to attach context blocks, continue previous conversations, or start new threads for distinct tasks.
 * [Agent Context](/agents/using-agents/agent-context) - Attach multimodal context directly to Warp’s Agent within the prompt.
 * [Managing Agents](/agents/using-agents/managing-agents) - Track, control, and configure all active agents in Warp using visual status indicators, in-app notifications, and the Agent Management Panel.
 * [Agent Profiles and Permissions](/agents/using-agents/agent-profiles-permissions) - Set up Profiles to control what permissions and autonomy Agents have to run commands, apply code changes, and more.
 * [Agent Task Lists](/agents/using-agents/agent-tasklists) - Track and manage complex workflows with automatic task lists that break requests into clear, actionable steps and update progress in real time.
 * [Model Choice](/agents/using-agents/model-choice) - Pick your preferred LLM for Warp’s Agent from a curated set of the top models, or rely on Warp to choose the optimal model.
 * [Active AI](/agents/active-ai) - Proactively recommends fixes and next actions based on errors, inputs, and outputs.
 * [Model Context Protocol](/knowledge-and-collaboration/mcp) - Expose data sources or tools to Warp’s Agents via MCP Servers.
 * [Rules](/knowledge-and-collaboration/rules) - Create and store Global and Project Rules to set guidelines and constraints for Agents.
 * [Generate](/agents/generate) - Look up commands and contextual suggestions for interactive CLIs in natural language.
 * [Voice](/agents/voice) - Talk to Warp AI using voice commands to accomplish tasks.
 * [AI Autofill in Warp Drive](/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/workflows#ai-autofill) - let Warp's Agent name and describe the workflows you create.
