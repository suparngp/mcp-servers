If you are looking to troubleshoot the TMUX SSH feature, see the [SSH](/terminal/warpify/ssh).
When you SSH into a remote box, you get all the features of Warp without any configuration on your part. The input editor, auto-completions, and history search work the same, regardless of machine.
[Limitations of SSH](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues/578) (as of May 2024):
 * The SSH Wrapper only supports `bash`or `zsh` shells in remote sessions.
 * If you're using a different shell, you'll want to use `command ssh` directly (see below for more details).
 * For zsh, xxd is required to bootstrap warp.
 * For Windows, [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) is required to bootstrap the SSH Wrapper.
 * RemoteCommand causes the ssh wrapper to fail.
 * [Tmux is not currently supported.](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/discussions/501)
If you're using zsh on the remote host, Warp creates a temp folder to act as the ZDOTDIR during the bootstrapping process and removes it when the shell is set up.

SSH
## 
[](#implementation)
Implementation
We create a wrapper (around `/usr/bin/ssh`) to set up the shell for Warp's feature set. We authenticate normally using `/usr/bin/ssh`, and bootstrap the remote shell to work with Warp Blocks and the Input Editor. You can opt out of this functionality by invoking `command ssh` directly.
 * Warp takes over the prompt which enables us to build a modern input editor.
 * Warp configures histcontrol to ignore commands with leading spaces. We do this so our bootstrapping code does not clutter the history.
You can see the SSH wrapper by using `which warp_ssh_helper` in zsh, `type warp_ssh_helper` in bash.
_Note:_ The ssh wrapper is only _initialized_ on your local machine. We donâ€™t currently support bootstrapping nested ssh sessions.
Warp [Completions](/terminal/command-completions/completions) for ssh show entries in `~/.ssh/config` and `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

Troubleshooting SSH
### 
[](#channel-2-open-failed-connect-failed-open-failed)
channel 2: open failed: connect failed: open failed
If you're seeing these errors, you may have some config on your server (usually in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) preventing Warp's ControlMaster connection from working. In this state, completions that require information from your remote host won't work and your history also won't work.
You should ensure that `MaxSessions` is either commented out or is at least `2`.
Write access in `/etc/ssh/` typically requires sudo access. After any edits, you'd also need to restart the `sshd` daemon.

SSH Wrapper fails
There are several [known issues with SSH Wrapper](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-desc+label%3ABugs+label%3ASSH). As a workaround to the SSH Wrapper, you can add `command ssh` to your `Settings > Subshells > Added commands`, then run `command ssh <user@server>` to connect to a remote session, this will attempt to enable Warp features as a [subshell](/terminal/warpify/subshells).
If the subshell workaround helps, we recommend you disable the SSH Wrapper in `Settings > Features.`You'll need to start a new session before a change is reflected or try invoking the SSH binary directly with `command ssh`.
