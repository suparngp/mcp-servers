Shared Block

Embedded Blocks
Create and embed your blocks on web pages to help your readers follow along with technical writing. Readers can interact with an embedded block as they would with a block in Warp, with a context menu and styling. When you click "Get embed", Warp will copy an `iframe` to your clipboard. Here's an example `iframe`:
Copy```
<iframe src="https://app.warp.dev/block/embed/qn0g1CqQnkYjEafPH5HCVT"
title="server script error" style="width: 712px; height: 397px; border:0;
overflow:hidden;" allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"></iframe>
```
