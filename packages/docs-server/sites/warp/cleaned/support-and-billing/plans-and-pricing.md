[](#warps-refund-policy)
Warp’s Refund Policy
If you signed up for a paid Warp subscription by mistake, please contact us at **[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**. We’ll issue a full refund if you downgrade within:
 * **72 hours** of starting a monthly plan, or
 * **30 days** of starting an annual plan,
provided you’ve used fewer than **150 AI credits** (the Free plan limit for the first two months). If you exceed that limit on an annual plan, we cannot refund the current month, but we will refund any unused future months.
We also may choose to offer refunds, on a case-by-case basis, if a severe product defect or problem with uptime availability occurs. While Warp does not yet provide a formal guaranteed uptime SLA, you can monitor live incidents on our [**Status Page**](https://status.warp.dev/) and track open issues on our [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues). 
To request a refund, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed8f84818184838aad9a8c9f9dc389889b) with detailed information about your situation—the more context you provide, the faster we can resolve your request.

Frequently asked questions
### 
[](#how-can-i-subscribe-to-a-warp-plan)
How can I subscribe to a Warp plan?
To subscribe to any Warp paid plan, start by [creating a Team in Warp](/knowledge-and-collaboration/teams#creating-a-team), even if you're subscribing as an individual. Once your team is created, you can upgrade:
 * In the app: Go to `Settings``Billing and usage`, then click the Upgrade link
 * Online: Visit [warp.dev/pricing](https://www.warp.dev/pricing)
After entering your payment details, you’ll receive an invoice and confirmation via email.
For Enterprise plans, [contact our sales team](https://warp.dev/contact-sales) and we’ll get in touch promptly.
### 
[](#how-can-i-upgrade-for-more-warp-ai-credits)
How can I upgrade for more Warp AI credits?
All paid Warp plans come with significantly higher monthly AI credit limits than the Free plan.
When you upgrade from Free to a paid plan, your AI credit usage resets. If you’re switching between paid plans, any AI usage you've already accumulated will carry over.
You can compare plans and AI limits at [warp.dev/pricing](https://www.warp.dev/pricing).
### 
[](#how-can-i-subscribe-to-a-warp-enterprise-plan)
How can I subscribe to a Warp Enterprise plan?
Warp offers two options for larger teams and organizations:
 * **Business Plan** : Supports up to 50 seats and is available for immediate upgrade. It includes Zero Data Retention by default and admin-controlled SAML-based SSO.
 * **Enterprise Plan** : Offers custom pricing and support for larger engineering orgs or teams with advanced security, compliance, or support needs.
If you’d like to explore Enterprise, [contact our sales team](https://warp.dev/contact-sales) and someone from Warp will follow up.
### 
[](#what-counts-as-a-team-member-and-how-does-billing-work-for-members)
What counts as a team member and how does billing work for members?
In Warp, a _team member_ is any seat with access to your Team — including the shared Warp Drive, Notebooks, Workflows, and other team resources. All plans allow you to invite unlimited users, but to unlock higher limits and advanced features, you’ll need to upgrade your team to a plan. Upgrading applies to your entire team, including your own account and all active members.
On the Free plan, you can share a limited number of Notebooks and Workflows with other Free users. If your team exceeds that limit, you’ll be prompted to [upgrade to a plan](https://app.warp.dev/upgrade). Once you upgrade, you’ll receive email notifications as team members accept invites. Billing is **prorated** , meaning you’re only charged for the days each member has access during your billing cycle. If a member leaves mid-cycle, Warp automatically applies a credit for the unused time to your next invoice.
**There are differences in how members are billed based on your payment schedule:**
 * **Monthly plans** : New members are billed immediately for the remaining time in the month.
 * **Annual plans** : New members are billed immediately for the remaining time in the year.
For example, if a member joins your Turbo monthly plan halfway through the month, you will be charged just half of the monthly fee ($25.00 out of $50). Similarly, if a member joins with four months remaining in an annual plan, you will be charged for those four months only, which amounts to $160 (4/12 of the annual $480).
If a member leaves part way through the billing cycle, Warp will issue a prorated credit based on the unused portion of their membership. This credit is applied to your team's next invoice, regardless of whether you're on a monthly or annual plan.
All members of the team will have the same subscription plan, you can't mix and match plans for each member of a team. In order to have different plans, you currently must have seperate teams.
### 
[](#what-is-the-value-of-joining-or-creating-a-team-on-warp)
What is the value of joining or creating a team on Warp?
Team members on plans have access to your shared [Warp Drive](/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive) objects and have unlimited access to Warp's collaboration features, including Session Sharing and Warp Drive storage.
### 
[](#my-co-workers-are-using-warp-but-were-not-on-a-team-together-yet.-how-does-billing-work)
My co-workers are using Warp but we’re not on a Team together yet. How does billing work?
Individual users with either personal or work email domains may continue to use Warp independently without incurring billing. The benefit of joining together on a Warp Team is that you get access to a shared Team Drive and collaboration features.
When you’re ready to use Warp more collaboratively, we suggest you nominate an Admin to [create a Team](https://docs.warp.dev/features/teams) and invite members to join. When your Team exceeds the Warp Drive limits, you will be prompted to upgrade to a Turbo plan.
### 
[](#how-does-usage-work-if-logged-into-the-same-account-on-multiple-devices)
How does usage work if logged into the same account on multiple devices?
When you use the account to sign into Warp on different devices, for example Linux on one computer and Windows on another, your usage of metered features like AI credits is tracked at the account level, not the device level. 
You can use your Warp account on multiple personal computers. Warp is designed to provide a consistent experience across devices. When you log in with the same account on different computers, your settings and preferences can be synced through the [Settings Sync](https://docs.warp.dev/features/settings-sync) feature.
### 
[](#what-happens-when-i-downgrade-during-a-billing-cycle)
What happens when I downgrade during a billing cycle?
To downgrade at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`. The subscription will immediately downgrade to the lower plan limits and the changes will be prorated. If you’re switching between paid plans, any AI usage you've already accumulated will carry over.
### 
[](#what-happens-when-i-cancel-during-a-billing-cycle)
What happens when I cancel during a billing cycle?
You can cancel at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`. The subscription will be canceled at the **end of your billing cycle** , monthly or yearly.
**You can continue to use your Warp paid plan features until the cycle end date**. Any additional team members added to your team will be invoiced at the end of your billing cycle.
### 
[](#what-happens-if-i-upgrade-from-monthly-to-annual-billing)
What happens if I upgrade from monthly to annual billing?
When upgrading from a monthly to annual billing cycle the billing is prorated, meaning you only pay for the annual portion of the year you haven't paid for yet. You will be billed for the remaining part of the billing year with the discounted rate.
To upgrade at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`.
### 
[](#what-happens-to-unused-ai-credits)
What happens to unused AI credits?
Unused AI credits do not rollover to the next cycle and can't be transferred to other accounts. You see when your credits will reset in the `Settings > Billing and usage` menu.
### 
[](#what-happens-if-my-payment-fails)
What happens if my payment fails?
If a payment fails, you will receive an email from Stripe and your Warp Team Settings will show a past-due alert. Certain paid plan features and the ability to invite new members will be locked down while your Team is in a past-due state. Paying the most recent invoice through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing` will fully re-enable your paid plan features.
### 
[](#what-counts-as-an-ai-credit)
What counts as an AI credit?
Each time you submit a prompt in Warp, whether to generate code, suggest a command, or accomplish a task, you initiate an interaction with the Agent. Please see more details in our [AI Credits](/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/ai-credits) page.
### 
[](#how-do-overages-work)
How do overages work?
Overages allow for pay-as-you-go access to premium AI models after reaching your monthly quota on Warp plans. Please see more details in our [Overages](/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) page.
### 
[](#what-counts-as-an-ai-token)
What counts as an AI token?
Tokens are chunks of text, such as words, parts of code, or characters, that large language models (LLMs) break down to analyze and generate responses. LLMs have a maximum number of tokens they can process at once. AI credits and suggestions are not the same as tokens, which are limited separately regardless of which plan you're on.
Warp now abstracts away token usage, so you don't need to manage or track it directly. You only need to monitor your **AI credit usage** , which is what’s measured in your plan limits and overages.
If you're curious, you can still learn more about tokens [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them), or refer to the pricing page for plan-level credit allocations. If you reach your monthly AI credit limits on a paid plan, premium models will be temporarily disabled until your quota resets at the start of your next billing cycle. 
If you’d like to continue using premium models beyond your included quota, you can enable [pay-as-you-go overages](/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) in `Settings > Billing and usage`. 
### 
[](#how-often-do-my-ai-credits-reset)
How often do my AI credits reset?
Allotted AI credits refill every 30 days from your signup date. When you upgrade to a [paid plan](https://www.warp.dev/pricing), you will be given more credits immediately. You can follow along with your refill period by referencing `Settings > Billing and usage`. Alternatively, you can also set [Overages](/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) to your desired amount to continue to use more premium model credits.
Unused AI credits do not rollover to the next cycle and can't be transferred to other accounts.
### 
[](#how-can-i-get-the-most-out-of-my-warp-paid-plan)
How can I get the most out of my Warp paid plan?
Warp's plans are designed for developers who rely on AI to code, debug, and move faster with their team.
 * With **Pro** , you get higher AI credit limits than the Free plan, support for larger codebases with [Codebase Context](/code/codebase-context), and access to premium models with optional pay-as-you-go overages.
 * **Warp Turbo** offers even higher AI credit limits, larger Codebase Context indexing, and the option to pay for additional usage beyond your included credits.
 * **Warp Lightspeed** is our most powerful plan, offering the highest AI credit limits, expanded codebase indexing, access to top-tier models, and pay-as-you-go overages so you can keep working without interruption.
 * **Warp Business** includes everything in Turbo, with advanced features like Zero Data Retention, SAML-based SSO, and support for teams up to 50 seats.
**All plans also unlock powerful collaboration and knowledge-sharing tools to help your team move faster, together:**
 * Use [Notebooks](/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/notebooks) and [Workflows](/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/workflows) in Warp Drive to organize and share knowledge across your team.
 * Try [Session Sharing](https://docs.warp.dev/features/session-sharing) to collaborate in real time through live, shared terminal sessions.
For the most up-to-date feature and usage details, visit [**warp.dev/pricing**](https://www.warp.dev/pricing).
### 
[](#can-i-use-a-free-plan-if-im-a-developer-at-a-large-company-or-organization)
Can I use a Free plan if I'm a developer at a large company or organization?
Yes. Developers at any company size are welcome to use Warp’s Free plan. 
If you need access to advanced collaboration features or higher limits, you may benefit from upgrading to Pro, Turbo, or Enterprise, but Warp does not require large organizations to upgrade.
### 
[](#are-there-any-warp-discounts-for-students-non-profits-or-open-source-teams)
Are there any Warp discounts for students, non-profits, or open-source teams?
Warp doesn’t currently offer discounts for students, non-profits, or open-source teams. We recommend exploring the Free plan, which includes all core terminal features and is a great starting point for individual or community use.
### 
[](#where-is-warp-drive-data-for-my-team-stored)
Where is Warp Drive data for my team stored?
Warp Drive data is securely stored on Google Cloud Platform servers located in the United States. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
For more details, please [visit the Security Overview](https://www.warp.dev/security) or contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#94e7f1f7e1e6fde0edd4e3f5e6e4baf0f1e2).
### 
[](#what-happened-to-the-lite-model)
What happened to the Lite model?
Over time, the Lite model—originally designed as a fallback when premium models ran out—began to deliver inconsistent results, especially for users running complex, multi-step prompts.
For credit-efficient usage, we encourage you to try our new Auto (cost-efficiency) model, which automatically selects the optimal model based on task complexity to help extend your credits. To continue AI usage please either [enable Overages](/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing/usage-overages) or [upgrade to a higher plan](/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#how-can-i-upgrade-for-more-warp-ai-credits).
If you have any questions or feedback, please connect with us in our [community Slack](/support-and-billing/sending-us-feedback#sending-warp-feedback).
### 
[](#what-payment-options-are-available-for-warps-self-service-plans)
What payment options are available for Warp's self-service plans?
Warp processes payments through Stripe. We currently accept credit or debit cards and US bank accounts.
At this time, we do not support ACH transfers, checks, cash, money orders, or cryptocurrency.
### 
[](#how-do-i-cancel-my-subscription)
How do I cancel my subscription?
You can cancel at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Billing and usage > Manage billing`. Cancelled subscriptions will remain active until the end of the billing cycle.
### 
[](#how-do-i-get-a-refund)
How do I get a refund?
For monthly subscriptions, we in general do not issue refunds. Please see [Warp's Refund Policy](/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#warps-refund-policy) for details and exceptions. 
You can remove the users you do not want to pay for in `Settings > Teams > Team Members`. Prorated refunds are issued as Warp credit, not cash.
### 
[](#why-doesnt-my-promo-code-work-or-why-was-it-disabled)
Why doesn't my promo code work or why was it disabled?
Warp's promotions are a way to try Warp before committing to a subscription, not get unlimited free or inexpensive AI. In order to prevent abuse, we're limiting promotion codes to first-time redemptions only. 
So each account can only use one promotion code. We also reserve the right to disable any promotion codes at any time and remove the associated subscriptions if we find that the code was being abused. 
### 
[](#how-can-i-subscribe-to-warp-as-tax-exempt)
How can I subscribe to Warp as tax exempt?
Warp does allow tax exempt organizations to subscribe, but there are some additional steps that you need to take.
 1. Create a Warp account, login, and go to the [upgrade page](https://app.warp.dev/upgrade), and select a plan, but **don't checkout or pay yet.** This will only setup your billing account in the system that will be used in the later steps.
 2. E-mail [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#35575c59595c5b5275425447451b515043) with your proof of your organization tax exempt status and your Warp account email.
 3. Warp's team will verify your tax exempt status and will change your account to tax exempt.
 4. Finally, subscribe to your plan of choice, you will see not taxes applied to the bill.
### 
[](#why-cant-i-subscribe-to-warp)
Why can't I subscribe to Warp?
There are certain prohibited and restricted businesses in which Stripe and major credit card networks will not process payments. For the most updated information, please see the full list [here](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses).
