Learn how to prompt Warp’s AI to produce accurate, design-faithful UI code using your preferred framework.

[](#intro)
Intro
This tutorial walks you through generating pixel-perfect front-end code using Warp. By treating the AI like a **UI engineer** , you can get closer to real implementation fidelity — especially when working from design mockups.
Although this example uses **React** and **Tailwind** , the same method applies to **Vue** , **Next.js** , or **Svelte**.

The Problem
When designing UI with AI, your intended design often gets lost in translation. AI struggles with visual fidelity — but structured prompts can help fix that.

### 
[](#the-prompt)
The Prompt
Step — Generate full specifications:
Copy```
Analyze this web design mockup as a senior UI engineer would. Create a complete technical specification:
1. DESIGN SYSTEM TOKENS:
 - Extract the color palette with semantic naming (primary, secondary, surface, text)
 - Identify the type scale (heading levels, body text sizes)
 - Document the spacing scale pattern (4px, 8px, 16px, etc.)
 - List border radius values used consistently
2. LAYOUT ARCHITECTURE:
 - Describe the overall page structure using semantic HTML5 elements
 - Identify CSS Grid vs Flexbox usage for each section
3. COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS:
 For each unique component, provide:
 - Semantic HTML structure
 - CSS layout method
 - All visual states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)
 - Exact dimensions and spacing
 - Animation/transition properties
4. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:
 - Describe how the layout adapts (even if only desktop is shown)
 - Note which elements stack, hide, or resize
 - Identify touch targets that need enlarging on mobile
5. ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:
 - Color contrast ratios for text/background combinations
 - Interactive element sizes (minimum 44x44px touch targets)
 - Focus indicator styles
 - Screen reader considerations for decorative elements
Format as a structured spec that includes both the visual description AND implementation notes. Flag any ambiguous design decisions that need clarification.
```
Next, give Warp the right prompt to start the code implementation:
Copy```
Using this design specification, build a responsive React component with Tailwind CSS:
Requirements:
- Create reusable components for each element in the spec
- Use CSS variables for the design tokens
- Implement all interactive states
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Add proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Include Framer Motion for any animations mentioned
- Match the spacing system exactly using Tailwind's spacing scale
Create a pixel-perfect implementation that matches the original design.
```

Validate and Iterate
Warp outputs component files and layout structure. You can review spacing, font weights, and responsive behavior directly in preview.
If details feel off, prompt again with clarifications like:
Copy```
Tighten vertical spacing between header and subtext.
```

Recap
You’ve learned how to:
 * Prompt AI for structured UI specs
 * Generate React + Tailwind implementations
 * Iterate visually for design parity
> Treating the AI like a teammate — not a tool — yields interfaces that finally match your vision.
