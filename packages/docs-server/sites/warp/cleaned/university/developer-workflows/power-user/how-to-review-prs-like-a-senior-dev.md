Learn how to prompt Warp’s AI to review pull requests like an experienced engineer — focusing on structure, red flags, and clarity

### 
[](#intro)
Intro
This tutorial teaches you how to use Warp to make **pull-request reviews faster and smarter**. Instead of relying on AI summaries, you’ll prompt Warp to generate an **index and priority list** , guiding your review order while flagging risky sections.
Although this example focuses on large PRs, the same workflow applies to **code reviews** , **design docs** , or **feature diffs**.

### 
[](#the-problem)
The Problem
Large PRs are difficult to parse. AI summaries gloss over nuance and may miss subtle issues — you need structured, prioritized insight instead.

### 
[](#the-prompt)
The Prompt
Use this in Warp’s AI input:
Prompt

## Prompt: Structured PR Review Format
> Review this pull request and format your response for rapid scanning by a busy maintainer. Follow the structure below.
---
### 1. 🚨 Risk Assessment
**Overall Risk:** 🔴 HIGH | 🟠 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW 
**Complexity:** [Simple | Moderate | Complex | Very Complex] 
**Blast Radius:** [Isolated | Module-wide | System-wide | External APIs affected] 
**Requires Immediate Review:** [YES / NO – why]
---
### 2. 🔍 Critical Issues 
_If none, write “None found” and skip to the next section._
#### 1. [CRITICAL ISSUE TITLE] 
**File:** `path/to/file.js:L125` 
**Impact:** Data loss / Security hole / System crash 
**Fix:** 
// Quick code fix example here
---
### 3. ⚠️ Concerns 
_Should discuss or fix before merge. If none, write “None found.”_ 
**Examples:** 
- [PERFORMANCE] Unindexed query on large table 
- [SECURITY] Missing input sanitization in login form 
---
### 4. 🎯 Maintainer Decision Guide 
**Merge confidence:** [0–100]% 
- □ Safe to merge after fixing blockers 
- □ Needs architecture discussion first 
- □ Requires performance testing 
- □ Get security team review 
- □ Author should split into smaller PRs 
**Time to properly review:** ~[X] minutes 
**Recommended reviewer expertise:** [Backend | Security | Database | Frontend] 
---
### 5. 🧭 Formatting Rules 
- Use emoji headers for instant visual recognition 
- Keep sections short; if empty, say “None found” 
- Blockers get full detail, everything else stays concise 
- Include code examples only for blockers 
- Bold key impact/risk words 
- Use consistent prefixes like [SECURITY], [PERFORMANCE], [LOGIC] for easy scanning 
- If PR is genuinely fine, end with: ✅ “This PR is safe to merge as-is.”
