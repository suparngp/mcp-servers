Learn how to use Warp’s Linear MCP integration to update tickets programmatically while maintaining a lean build strategy.

Overview
This walkthrough demonstrates:
 * Updating Linear tickets via Warp’s MCP integration
 * Structuring tasks around a lean development stack
 * Observing real-time synchronization of ticket data
 * Testing agent autonomy when editing related subtasks

### 
[](#setting-up-the-scenario)
Setting Up the Scenario
The goal is to use Warp’s agent to update a Linear epic with a new, leaner build approach and reflect the changes in related subtasks.
First, open your Linear project and locate the target epic. Copy the **ticket ID** (e.g. “Empty Studio 36”).
2
### 
[](#define-the-update-prompt)
Define the Update Prompt
Within Warp, run the MCP command to edit the Linear issue.
**Prompt**
Prompt
Copy```
Use the warp-server-staging gcloud project and pull logs for the last 10 minutes from the warp-server Cloud Run instance.
Organize them by info, warning, and error levels.
Create a histogram across message types, and highlight the most concerning errors to investigate.
```
Warp parses the issue context and updates the ticket’s fields accordingly.

### 
[](#observing-the-changes)
Observing the Changes
After execution:
 * The Linear ticket reflects the new **Next.js + Supabase** stack.
 * Tasks like _Build Foundation_ , _Implement AI-powered PRD Generation_ , and _Set up Development Environment_ are updated.
 * Time estimates automatically adjust from _4–6 weeks_ to _2–3 weeks_.
 * Complex integrations (AI and Linear App) are deferred to a future phase.

### 
[](#propagating-updates-to-child-tasks)
Propagating Updates to Child Tasks
Warp’s agent can cascade changes to linked subtasks. If it begins editing other epics unexpectedly, you can constrain its scope by specifying task IDs in the prompt:
Scope Constraint
Copy```
Only update the ticket with ID <ticket_number>.
Do not modify other epics or related tickets.
```
5
### 
[](#review-and-verification)
Review and Verification
Re-open the Linear epic to confirm updates:
 * **Frontend specs** reflect the lean stack.
 * **Child tasks** align with phase 1 deliverables.
 * **Deferred features** (e.g., advanced integrations) are pushed to phase 2.
This demonstrates Warp’s ability to _maintain and modify tickets intelligently_ , not just create them.
