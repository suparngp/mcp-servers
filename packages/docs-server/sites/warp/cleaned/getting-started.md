Key Features:
 * [**Warp Code**](/code/code-overview): Warp is optimized for writing code by prompt on large, existing codebases. When Warp detects an opportunity to write code, it will enter an advanced code generation flow.
 * [**Agents**](/agents/agents-overview): Warp autodetects whether you are typing a natural language prompt or a command. Use natural language prompts to have Warp write code, debug issues, or write commands for you.
 * [**Context management**](/agents/using-agents/agent-context): Warp will use codebase context, images, URLs, and documentation you save in Warp as context for agents. 
 * [**Multi-agent management**](/agents/using-agents/managing-agents): Warp is designed to have multiple agents running at once. Agents will send you notifications if they require your input, and you can see all your agents in one panel.
 * [**Modern UX and Text Editing**](/terminal/editor): Inputs (commands or prompts) and outputs are grouped into easy to use Blocks, and you can use your cursor or customizable keybindings to easily navigate Warpâ€™s input editor.
You can fully customize Warp's appearance, prompts, settings, and keybindings to fit your preferences. Warp works with zsh, bash, fish, and PowerShell, and is built with Rust for high performance.
For an inside look at how Warp is built, you can read the blog post on [How Warp Works](https://www.warp.dev/blog/how-warp-works).
