Referral Program Terms and Conditions
> **Last Updated:** November 27, 2024
### 
[](#id-1-referral-an-exclusive-theme)
1 referral: An exclusive theme
When someone joins Warp with your referral code, the referral theme will become available in your theme picker after you restart the app. We also send an email alerting you. This reward is available to all users worldwide.
### 
[](#all-other-referral-tiers)
All other referral tiers
Once you've hit the other referral tiers, we'll email you with details on how to claim your reward. Physical rewards are available to users residing in the United States, and Warp will cover shipping costs for these users. International users can also claim physical rewards; however, they will be responsible for any customs fees. For all users, there's an option to claim a digital reward (gift card) instead of physical Warp swag.
### 
[](#international-users)
International users
International users who choose physical rewards are responsible for paying any customs fees associated with shipping. Estimated costs are provided in the [approximate customs fees by region](/community/refer-a-friend#approximate-customs-fees-by-region) section below. Please note that once the package leaves the United States, Warp no longer has visibility or control over the shipment process, including any customs-related issues or fees that may arise.
Alternatively, international users may opt to receive a digital gift card instead of a physical reward.
Note: for users who qualified for referral rewards before October 15th, 2024, Warp will cover all shipping and customs costs. Starting from that date onwards, international users receiving referral rewards will be responsible for paying any customs fees associated with shipping.
### 
[](#shipping-time-frame)
Shipping time frame
Physical rewards may take 2 to 3 weeks to arrive for users located in the United States, and 4 to 12 weeks for international users. After claiming your order, you will receive an email with a shipping confirmation and a tracking link from Printfection, our swag vendor.
If you have any questions about the status of your shipment or order, please reach out to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with your order number.
### 
[](#general-terms-and-conditions)
General terms and conditions
Referrals must be valid and confirmed by Warp to count towards rewards. This means the referred user must accept the referral via the referral link and log into Warp's desktop application.
Warp reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to disqualify any referrals deemed fraudulent. Any users who refer fake emails or users will be disqualified at the sole discretion of Warp.
Warp reserves the right to modify or terminate the referral rewards program at any time without prior notice. Participation in the swag program constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions.
If you have any questions about the referral program, please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2557404340575744495665524457550b414053).

Referral Rewards Program FAQs
#### 
[](#i-have-referred-people-but-have-not-received-an-email)
**"I have referred people but have not received an email."**
Please allow a few hours for the referral system to process and send email updates. If you still haven’t received an email after a reasonable amount of time, contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a3d1c6c5c6d1d1c2cfd0e3d4c2d1d38dc7c6d5) and we'll look into it.
#### 
[](#ive-claimed-my-physical-reward-but-have-issues-receiving-my-package)
**"I've claimed my physical reward but have issues receiving my package."**
If you experience issues with your shipment, please respond to the shipping notification email you should have received from Printfection. For further assistance, contact our swag vendor’s operations team at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#62111712120d10162212100b0c16040701160b0d0c4c010d0f) with your order number.
#### 
[](#ive-referred-friends-but-they-didnt-use-the-link.-does-it-still-count)
**"I've referred friends, but they didn't use the link. Does it still count?"**
Unfortunately, any referrals who didn't use your link will not count towards the rewards, and we have no way of modifying the referral count.
#### 
[](#ive-referred-friends-but-they-joined-anonymously.-does-it-still-count)
**"I've referred friends, but they joined anonymously. Does it still count?"**
For a referral to count, new users must sign up and actively use Warp. Unfortunately, we’re unable to associate anonymous users with specific referral links at this time.
We’re actively working on solutions to make the referral process more seamless and reliable for anonymous users. Stay tuned for updates as we improve this experience.
#### 
[](#the-reward-tiers-recently-changed-with-the-new-swag-items.-i-previously-qualified-for-x.-what-happen)
**"The reward tiers recently changed with the new swag items. I previously qualified for X. What happens now, and are the new swag items retroactive?"**
Our referral program was updated on November 21, 2024, with new reward tiers and exciting swag options. To ensure a smooth transition, we will honor previous reward tiers alongside the updated program until December 15, 2024.
If you’re unsure how these changes impact your previous qualifications or eligibility for the new swag items, feel free to reach out to us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for assistance.
