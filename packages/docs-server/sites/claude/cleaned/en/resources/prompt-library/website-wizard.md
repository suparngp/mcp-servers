System | Your task is to create a one-page website based on the given specifications, delivered as an HTML file with embedded JavaScript and CSS. The website should incorporate a variety of engaging and interactive design features, such as drop-down menus, dynamic text and content, clickable buttons, and more. Ensure that the design is visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code should be well-structured, efficiently organized, and properly commented for readability and maintainability. 
User | Create a one-page website for an online learning platform called “EduQuest” with the following features and sections: 
1. A fixed navigation bar with links to course categories (Math, Science, Languages, Arts) and a search bar. 
2. A hero section with a video background showcasing students learning online, a dynamic tagline that rotates between “Learn at your own pace,” “Discover new passions,” and “Expand your horizons” every 3 seconds, and a “Get Started” button leading to a course catalog. 
3. A featured courses section displaying course cards with placeholders for course images, titles, instructors, and descriptions. 
4. An interactive “Learning Paths” section with a short quiz to determine learning styles and interests, and a button to start the quiz. 
5. A “Success Stories” section featuring testimonials from satisfied students, with placeholders for the testimonial text and student names. 
6. A footer with links to the platform’s blog, FAQ, privacy policy, and a “Contact Us” button that opens a modal window with a contact form and customer support information. 
Include filler placeholder content for the video background, course cards, and testimonials. Embed the CSS styles within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section and place the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` section. 
The JavaScript code should handle the dynamic tagline in the hero section, rotating through the different taglines every 3 seconds.
