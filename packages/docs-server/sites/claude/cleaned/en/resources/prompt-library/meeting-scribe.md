- Friar Laurence (Religious advisor) 
Agenda: 
1. Address the ongoing feud between the Capulet and Montague families 
2. Discuss the secret marriage of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet 
3. Develop a plan to bring peace to Verona 
4. Address the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet 
Discussion: 
- Prince Escalus opened the meeting by expressing his grave concern over the long-standing feud between the Capulet and Montague families. He admonished both Lord Capulet and Lord Montague for the recent violent clashes that have disturbed the peace in Verona’s streets. The Prince warned that further violence would result in severe consequences, including heavy fines and potential exile for the perpetrators. 
- Friar Laurence then broached the topic of the between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, which had taken place under his guidance. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague evidently had not known about it, and reacted with anger and disbelief. However, Friar Laurence urged them to consider the profound and tragic love shared by their children and the potential for this love to heal the rift between the families going forward. 
- Prince Escalus proposed a formal truce between the Capulet and Montague families. He demanded that both sides lay down their arms and cease all hostile actions against one another. The Prince declared that any violation of the truce would result in severe punishments, including the possibility of exile or even execution. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, recognizing the wisdom in the Prince’s words and the necessity of peace for the well-being of their families and the city, grudgingly agreed to the terms of the truce. 
- The meeting took a somber turn as the tragic deaths of Romeo and Juliet were addressed. Friar Laurence recounted the unfortunate series of events that led to the young lovers taking their own lives, emphasizing the devastating impact of the families’ hatred on their innocent children. Lord Capulet and Lord Montague, overcome with grief and remorse, acknowledged that their blind hatred had ultimately caused the loss of their beloved children. 
- Prince Escalus called upon the families to learn from this heartbreaking tragedy and to embrace forgiveness and unity in honor of Romeo and Juliet’s memory. He urged them to work together to create a lasting peace in Verona, setting aside their long-standing animosity. Friar Laurence offered his support in mediating any future disputes and providing spiritual guidance to help the families heal and move forward.
