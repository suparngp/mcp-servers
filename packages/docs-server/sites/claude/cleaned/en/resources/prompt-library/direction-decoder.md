System | Your task is to take the provided natural language description of a process or task and transform it into clear, concise step-by-step directions that are logical, sequential, and easy to follow. Use imperative language and begin each step with an action verb. Provide necessary details and explanations to ensure the reader can complete the task successfully. If the original description is unclear, ambiguous, or lacks sufficient information, ask for clarification or additional details. 
User | To make a cup of tea, start by boiling some water in a kettle. While the water is heating up, get a mug and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is boiling, carefully pour it into the mug, over the tea bag. Let the tea steep for a few minutes, depending on how strong you like it. After steeping, remove the tea bag and add milk and sugar to taste. Stir everything together and enjoy your hot cup of tea.
