The Files API lets you upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without re-uploading content with each request. This is particularly useful when using the [code execution tool](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) to provide inputs (e.g. datasets and documents) and then download outputs (e.g. charts). You can also use the Files API to prevent having to continually re-upload frequently used documents and images across multiple API calls. You can [explore the API reference directly](/en/api/files-create), in addition to this guide.
The Files API is currently in beta. Please reach out through our [feedback form](https://forms.gle/tisHyierGwgN4DUE9) to share your experience with the Files API.
## 
[​](#supported-models)
Supported models
Referencing a `file_id` in a Messages request is supported in all models that support the given file type. For example, [images](/en/docs/build-with-claude/vision) are supported in all Claude 3+ models, [PDFs](/en/docs/build-with-claude/pdf-support) in all Claude 3.5+ models, and [various other file types](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#supported-file-types) for the code execution tool in Claude 3.5 Haiku plus all Claude 3.7+ models. The Files API is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI.
## 
[​](#how-the-files-api-works)
How the Files API works
The Files API provides a simple create-once, use-many-times approach for working with files:
 * **Upload files** to our secure storage and receive a unique `file_id`
 * **Download files** that are created from the code execution tool
 * **Reference files** in [Messages](/en/api/messages) requests using the `file_id` instead of re-uploading content
 * **Manage your files** with list, retrieve, and delete operations
## 
[​](#how-to-use-the-files-api)
How to use the Files API
To use the Files API, you’ll need to include the beta feature header: `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`.
### 
[​](#uploading-a-file)
Uploading a file
Upload a file to be referenced in future API calls:
Shell
Python
TypeScript
Copy
```
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
 -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
 -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
 -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
 -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf"
```
The response from uploading a file will include:
Copy
```
{
 "id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w",
 "type": "file",
 "filename": "document.pdf",
 "mime_type": "application/pdf",
 "size_bytes": 1024000,
 "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
 "downloadable": false
}
```
### 
[​](#using-a-file-in-messages)
Using a file in messages
Once uploaded, reference the file using its `file_id`:
Shell
Python
TypeScript
Copy
```
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
 -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
 -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
 -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
 -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -d '{
 "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
 "max_tokens": 1024,
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": [
 {
 "type": "text",
 "text": "Please summarize this document for me." 
 },
 {
 "type": "document",
 "source": {
 "type": "file",
 "file_id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w"
 }
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
 }'
```
### 
[​](#file-types-and-content-blocks)
File types and content blocks
The Files API supports different file types that correspond to different content block types: File Type | MIME Type | Content Block Type | Use Case 
---|---|---|--- 
PDF | `application/pdf` | `document` | Text analysis, document processing 
Plain text | `text/plain` | `document` | Text analysis, processing 
Images | `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp` | `image` | Image analysis, visual tasks 
[Datasets, others](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#supported-file-types) | Varies | `container_upload` | Analyze data, create visualizations 
### 
[​](#working-with-other-file-formats)
Working with other file formats
For file types that are not supported as `document` blocks (.csv, .txt, .md, .docx, .xlsx), convert the files to plain text, and include the content directly in your message:
Shell
Python
TypeScript
Copy
```
# Example: Reading a text file and sending it as plain text
# Note: For files with special characters, consider base64 encoding
TEXT_CONTENT=$(cat document.txt | jq -Rs .)
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
 -H "content-type: application/json" \
 -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
 -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
 -d @- <<EOF
{
 "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
 "max_tokens": 1024,
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": [
 {
 "type": "text",
 "text": "Here's the document content:\n\n${TEXT_CONTENT}\n\nPlease summarize this document."
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
}
EOF
```
For .docx files containing images, convert them to PDF format first, then use [PDF support](/en/docs/build-with-claude/pdf-support) to take advantage of the built-in image parsing. This allows using citations from the PDF document.
#### 
[​](#document-blocks)
Document blocks
For PDFs and text files, use the `document` content block:
Copy
```
{
 "type": "document",
 "source": {
 "type": "file",
 "file_id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w"
 },
 "title": "Document Title", // Optional
 "context": "Context about the document", // Optional 
 "citations": {"enabled": true} // Optional, enables citations
}
```
#### 
[​](#image-blocks)
Image blocks
For images, use the `image` content block:
Copy
```
{
 "type": "image",
 "source": {
 "type": "file",
 "file_id": "file_011CPMxVD3fHLUhvTqtsQA5w"
 }
}
```
### 
[​](#managing-files)

 -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
```
#### 
[​](#delete-a-file)
Delete a file
Remove a file from your workspace:
Shell
Python
TypeScript
Copy
```
curl -X DELETE https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w \
 -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \

[​](#file-storage-and-limits)
File storage and limits
### 
[​](#storage-limits)
Storage limits
 * **Maximum file size:** 500 MB per file
 * **Total storage:** 100 GB per organization
### 
[​](#file-lifecycle)
File lifecycle
 * Files are scoped to the workspace of the API key. Other API keys can use files created by any other API key associated with the same workspace
 * Files persist until you delete them
 * Deleted files cannot be recovered
 * Files are inaccessible via the API shortly after deletion, but they may persist in active `Messages` API calls and associated tool uses
 * Files that users delete will be deleted in accordance with our [data retention policy](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-my-organization-s-data).
* * *
## 
[​](#error-handling)
Error handling
Common errors when using the Files API include:
 * **File not found (404):** The specified `file_id` doesn’t exist or you don’t have access to it
 * **Invalid file type (400):** The file type doesn’t match the content block type (e.g., using an image file in a document block)
 * **Exceeds context window size (400):** The file is larger than the context window size (e.g. using a 500 MB plaintext file in a `/v1/messages` request)
 * **Invalid filename (400):** Filename doesn’t meet the length requirements (1-255 characters) or contains forbidden characters (`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, `*`, `\`, `/`, or unicode characters 0-31)
 * **File too large (413):** File exceeds the 500 MB limit
 * **Storage limit exceeded (403):** Your organization has reached the 100 GB storage limit
