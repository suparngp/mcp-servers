## 
[​](#determine-memory-type)
Determine memory type
Claude Code offers four memory locations in a hierarchical structure, each serving a different purpose: Memory Type | Location | Purpose | Use Case Examples | Shared With 
---|---|---|---|--- 
**Enterprise policy** | macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` 
Linux: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` 
Windows: `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md` | Organization-wide instructions managed by IT/DevOps | Company coding standards, security policies, compliance requirements | All users in organization 
**Project memory** | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows | Team members via source control 
**User memory** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts | Just you (all projects) 
**Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project-specific preferences | _(Deprecated, see below)_ Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data | Just you (current project) 
All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code’s context when launched. Files higher in the hierarchy take precedence and are loaded first, providing a foundation that more specific memories build upon.
## 
[​](#claude-md-imports)
CLAUDE.md imports
CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:
Copy
```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.
# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```
Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user’s home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Previously CLAUDE.local.md served a similar purpose, but is now deprecated in favor of imports since they work better across multiple git worktrees.
Copy
```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```
To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.
Copy
```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```
Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.
## 
[​](#how-claude-looks-up-memories)
How Claude looks up memories
Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory _/_ and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in _foo/bar/_ , and have memories in both _foo/CLAUDE.md_ and _foo/bar/CLAUDE.md_. Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.
## 
[​](#quickly-add-memories-with-the-%23-shortcut)
Quickly add memories with the `#` shortcut
The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the `#` character:
Copy
```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```
You’ll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.
## 
[​](#directly-edit-memories-with-%2Fmemory)
Directly edit memories with `/memory`
Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.
## 
[​](#set-up-project-memory)
Set up project memory
Suppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands. Project memory can be stored in either `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Bootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:
Copy
```
> /init 
```
Tips:
 * Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches
 * Document code style preferences and naming conventions
 * Add important architectural patterns specific to your project
 * CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.
## 
[​](#organization-level-memory-management)
Organization-level memory management
Enterprise organizations can deploy centrally managed CLAUDE.md files that apply to all users. To set up organization-level memory management:
 1. Create the enterprise memory file in the appropriate location for your operating system:
 * macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md`
 * Linux/WSL: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`
 * Windows: `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md`
 1. Deploy via your configuration management system (MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, etc.) to ensure consistent distribution across all developer machines.
## 
[​](#memory-best-practices)
Memory best practices
 * **Be specific** : “Use 2-space indentation” is better than “Format code properly”.
 * **Use structure to organize** : Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
 * **Review periodically** : Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.
