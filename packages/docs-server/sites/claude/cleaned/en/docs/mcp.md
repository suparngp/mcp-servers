[Welcome](/en/home)[Claude Developer Platform](/en/docs/intro)[Claude Code](/en/docs/claude-code/overview)[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/docs/mcp)[API Reference](/en/api/messages)[Resources](/en/resources/overview)[Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview)
 * [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/docs/mcp)
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
