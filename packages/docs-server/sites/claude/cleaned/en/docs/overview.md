This guide introduces Claude’s enterprise capabilities, the end-to-end flow for developing with Claude, and how to start building.
## 
[​](#what-you-can-do-with-claude)
What you can do with Claude
Claude is designed to empower enterprises at scale with strong performance across benchmark evaluations for reasoning, math, coding, and fluency in English and non-English languages. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of Claude’s capabilities and common uses. Capability | Enables you to… 
---|--- 
Text and code generation | 
 * Adhere to brand voice for excellent customer-facing experiences such as copywriting and chatbots
 * Create production-level code and operate (in-line code generation, debugging, and conversational querying) within complex codebases
 * Build automatic translation features between languages
 * Conduct complex financial forecasts
 * Support legal use cases that require high-quality technical analysis, long context windows for processing detailed documents, and fast outputs
Vision | 
 * Process and analyze visual input, such as extracting insights from charts and graphs
 * Generate code from images with code snippets or templates based on diagrams
 * Describe an image for a user with low vision
Tool use | 
 * Interact with external client-side tools and functions, allowing Claude to reason, plan, and execute actions by generating structured outputs through API calls
## 
[​](#enterprise-considerations)
Enterprise considerations
Along with an extensive set of features, tools, and capabilities, Claude is also built to be secure, trustworthy, and scalable for wide-reaching enterprise needs. Feature | Description 
---|--- 
**Secure** | 
 * [Enterprise-grade](https://trust.anthropic.com/) security and data handling for API
 * SOC II Type 2 certified, HIPAA compliance options for API
 * Accessible through AWS (GA) and GCP (in private preview)
**Trustworthy** | 
 * Resistant to jailbreaks and misuse. We continuously monitor prompts and outputs for harmful, malicious use cases that violate our [AUP](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).
 * Copyright indemnity protections for paid commercial services
 * Uniquely positioned to serve high trust industries that process large volumes of sensitive user data
**Capable** | 
 * 200K token context window for expanded use cases, with future support for 1M
 * [Tool use](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), also known as function calling, which allows seamless integration of Claude into specialized applications and custom workflows
 * Multimodal input capabilities with text output, allowing you to upload images (such as tables, graphs, and photos) along with text prompts for richer context and complex use cases
 * [Developer Console](https://console.anthropic.com) with Workbench and prompt generation tool for easier, more powerful prompting and experimentation
 * [SDKs](/en/api/client-sdks) and [APIs](/en/api) to expedite and enhance development
**Reliable** | 
 * Very low hallucination rates
 * Accurate over long documents
**Global** | 
 * Great for coding tasks and fluency in English and non-English languages like Spanish and Japanese
 * Enables use cases like translation services and broader global utility
**Cost conscious** | 
 * Family of models balances cost, performance, and intelligence

[​](#implementing-claude)
Implementing Claude
1
Scope your use case
 * Identify a problem to solve or tasks to automate with Claude.
 * Define requirements: features, performance, and cost.
2
Design your integration
 * Select Claude’s capabilities (e.g., vision, tool use) and models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) based on needs.
 * Choose a deployment method, such as the Claude API, AWS Bedrock, or Vertex AI.
3
Prepare your data
 * Identify and clean relevant data (databases, code repos, knowledge bases) for Claude’s context.
4
Develop your prompts
 * Use Workbench to create evals, draft prompts, and iteratively refine based on test results.
 * Deploy polished prompts and monitor real-world performance for further refinement.
5
Implement Claude
 * Set up your environment, integrate Claude with your systems (APIs, databases, UIs), and define human-in-the-loop requirements.
6
Test your system
 * Conduct red teaming for potential misuse and A/B test improvements.
7
Deploy to production
 * Once your application runs smoothly end-to-end, deploy to production.
8
Monitor and improve
 * Monitor performance and effectiveness to make ongoing improvements.
