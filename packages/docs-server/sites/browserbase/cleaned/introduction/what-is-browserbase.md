Browserbase is a platform for running [headless browsers](/introduction/what-is-headless-browser). If you’re building automations that need to interact with websites, fill out forms, or replicate users actions, Browserbase manages that infrastructure so you don’t have to maintain your own fleet of headless browsers. It provides a simple API for controlling browsers, useful features for managing browser sessions, and a scalable infrastructure for running them in production.
## [Getting Started This simple, step-by-step tutorial will help you get started with Browserbase. Start your first cloud browser in no time. ](/introduction/getting-started)## [Try our Playground Discover and experiment with the full developer experience right in your browser.
