Plan Overview
Browserbase offers flexible plans that scale with your automation needs—from solo builders to enterprise teams. Your browser hours and proxy bandwidth renew monthly. Sessions are billed by the minute, with the first minute rounded up.

[​](#which-plan-should-i-choose%3F)
Which Plan Should I Choose?
 * **Free Plan** : Best for testing or one-off automations.
 * **Developer Plan** : Ideal for small projects or early development with moderate concurrency.
 * **Startup Plan** : Great for most teams. Supports production workflows with higher concurrency, lower usage costs, and built-in captcha solving.
 * **Scale Plan** : Best for teams with large-scale automation needs, Advanced Stealth requirements, or compliance needs. ## [Upgrade Your Plan Manage your account, upgrade your plan, or add team members. ](/guides/manage-account)

[​](#what-happens-after-you-hit-your-limit%3F)
What Happens After You Hit Your Limit?
If you’re on the **Developer** or **Startup** plan, you won’t be cut off when you exceed your included usage. Instead, you’ll be charged at the overage rate.
 * **Browser hours** continue at your plan’s overage rate
 * $0.12/hour on Developer
 * $0.10/hour on Startup
 * **Proxy bandwidth** continues at your plan’s overage rate
 * $12/GB on Developer
 * $10/GB on Startup
You’ll see these additional charges on your monthly invoice. There’s no cap—so you can keep scaling without disruption.
> Tip: Monitor your usage from [your dashboard](https://www.browserbase.com/overview) to avoid surprises.
## 
[​](#session-creation-rate-limit)
Session Creation Rate Limit
Each plan also includes a limit on **how many sessions (browsers) you can create per minute**. If you attempt to create too many sessions in a short time, you might temporarily hit your creation cap—even if you haven’t reached your max concurrency yet.
> For example: On the Startup Plan, your session creation limit is 50 per minute and your max concurrency is 100, it will take about 2 minutes to spin up all 100 sessions.
In most workflows, this won’t be an issue—especially if your sessions run longer than a minute. If your sessions are short-lived, consider using the [keep-alive feature](/guides/long-running-sessions#keep-alive-sessions) to reconnect and reuse the same browser session instead of creating a new one.

Understanding Your Monthly Bill
Here’s the breakdown of your monthly bill:
 * Base Plan Cost
 * Proxy Costs
 * Browser Time Costs
A Developer Plan with overages appears like this on an invoice: ![Stripe Invoice](https://mintcdn.com/browserbase/o2z3G-33EMy2GO0Y/images/guides/plans-and-pricing/stripe-invoice.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=o2z3G-33EMy2GO0Y&q=85&s=99f6b0d1173f48d26060aa9a3179f745) You can also manage this on your Organization settings page under “Manage Billing”: [https://www.browserbase.com/orgs/{slug}/settings](https://www.browserbase.com/orgs/%7Bslug%7D/settings)
