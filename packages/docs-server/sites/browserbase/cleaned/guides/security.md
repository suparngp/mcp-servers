[​](#why-enterprises-trust-browserbase)
Why Enterprises Trust Browserbase
### 
[​](#enterprise-grade-compliance)
Enterprise-Grade Compliance
 * **SOC 2 Type II Certified**
 * **HIPAA Compliant** : Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) available
 * Comprehensive third-party **penetration testing** with successful results
 * Full access to security documentation (e.g., auditor attestations, Compliance portal access) provided on request

Secure by Design
#### 
[​](#zero-trust-browser-isolation)
Zero Trust Browser Isolation
Browserbase follows a zero-trust architecture, assuming that any browser may be compromised. This design philosophy ensures comprehensive containment and minimizes risk.
 * **Browser Isolation** : Each browser runs in a dedicated VM, providing strong isolation at the hardware virtualization layer.
 * **Network Isolation** : Every browser runs in an isolated subnet with strict firewalls to prevent lateral movement.
 * **No Browser Reuse** : After each session, the virtual machine is killed and recreated from scratch, ensuring that every browser session is completely fresh.
 * **No GPU Access** : To avoid known security risks associated with shared GPU memory attacks.
#### 
[​](#patch-management)
Patch Management
 * Continuous updates with fast turnaround for critical CVEs
 * Chrome versions patched proactively and automatically.
 * Compatibility testing for enterprise environments ensures stability across browser updates
### 
[​](#transparent-data-handling)
Transparent Data Handling
 * **Zero Data Retention** : [Disable Logging](/reference/api/create-a-session#body-browser-settings-log-session) and [Session Recording](/reference/api/create-a-session#body-browser-settings-record-session) via the [Create Session API](/reference/api/create-a-session) to ensure no data is recorded.
 * **Configurable Browser Regions** : Choose your closest data center to minimize latency and ensure data sovereignty
 * US West
 * US East
 * EU (Germany)
 * Asia (Singapore)
### 
[​](#guardrails-for-ai-web-browsing)
Guardrails for AI Web Browsing
Browserbase offers AI-assisted browsing via Stagehand—a framework designed for safe, deterministic automation.
#### 
[​](#stagehand-framework-benefits)
Stagehand Framework Benefits
 * **Atomic, auditable steps** : Workflows are built as a series of deterministic, cacheable commands
 * **Self-healing automation** : If a selector changes, Stagehand retries using an LLM fallback only for that atomic step
 * **No full-page hallucinations** : Minimizes AI unpredictability by limiting LLM scope
 * **Prompt Templating** : Sensitive data can be parameterized and injected at runtime to avoid LLM exposure
 * **Bring Your Own Model (BYO-LLM)** : Maintain full control with your preferred model, keys, and compliance framework
* * *

Security Architecture at a Glance
Feature | Implementation 
---|--- 
**Isolation** | 1 browser per VM 
**Network Security** | Individual subnets and strict firewall rules 
**Logging Control** | Optional; disable logs and session video replays at any time 
**Data Residency** | Configurable by region (US/EU/Asia) 
**Model Control** | BYO-LLM with full interceptor customization 
**Compliance** | SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, third-party pen testing
