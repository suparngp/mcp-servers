  "description": "In modern application development, feature flags are the guardrails that keep experiments controlled and rollbacks safe when conditions shift. If feature flags act as the guardrails, observability provides the visibility: the headlights (traces), mirrors (logs), and dashboard instruments (metrics) that reveal what’s happening in the environment and how well a feature is performing. Together, feature flags and observability unlock powerful insights by correlating code changes with real-time system behavior. This combination reduces time-to-diagnosis and builds greater confidence when rolling out new features."
