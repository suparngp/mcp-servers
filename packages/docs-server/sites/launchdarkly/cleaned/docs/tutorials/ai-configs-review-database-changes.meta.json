  "description": "At LaunchDarkly, we’re constantly pushing the boundaries of what it means to move fast without breaking things. We ship frequently, serve **quadrillions of events per day** , and operate with **zero tolerance for downtime**. To keep pace, we need systems that help us ship confidently—even when change is happening at a rapid, “vibe coding” pace."
