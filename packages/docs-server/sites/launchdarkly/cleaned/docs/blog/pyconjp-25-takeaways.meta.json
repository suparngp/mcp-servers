  "description": "I attended [PyCon US in Pittsburgh](https://us.pycon.org/2025/) with LaunchDarkly in May and had a memorable time! I didn’t know how wonderful of a community event it was. I met representatives from [PyCon APAC](https://pycon.asia/) and chatted to them about what the tech community is like abroad."
