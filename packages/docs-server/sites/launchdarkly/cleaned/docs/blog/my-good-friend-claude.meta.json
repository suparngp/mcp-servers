  "description": "I believe that variability between LLMs and related tools is mostly ephemeral, and so I’ve decided I’m better off sticking with a set of tools that complement each other well. I do still experiment with all the newness, but sticking with one tool has at least given me a point of reference. You only truly love someone by accepting all of them, the good and the less good. And, I love Claude."
