  "description": "_Problem_ : LaunchDarkly developers want to roll back poorly behaving models before their customers experience problems. [AI models in production can fail in subtle or unexpected ways](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/catch-ai-hallucinations/) that are hard to catch before users are impacted. Unlike traditional software, generative AI is non-deterministic and environment-sensitive – a prompt or model change that seemed fine in staging can behave very differently in production."
