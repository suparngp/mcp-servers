by Mike Rose, Senior IT Security Engineer, LaunchDarkly
## 👋 Introduction
I attended [**DEF CON 33**](https://defcon.org/ "https://defcon.org/") this year in Las Vegas and want to share a recap of my experiences and insights from the event. Whether you’re a seasoned security practitioner or just DEF CON-curious, I hope this gives you a helpful window into what goes on at one of the world’s largest hacker conferences.
**Spoiler alert** : AI dominated the conference discussions.
* * *
## 🎯 Why I attended
I went into DEF CON this year with a few goals in mind:
1️⃣ Stay up-to-date on emerging threats.
2️⃣ Find practical inspiration for our security workflows at LaunchDarkly.
3️⃣ Catch up with old friends and colleagues.
* * *
## 🔍 Favorite talks & villages
### Talks
### 📍 Amplifying Phishing Attacks with Generative AI
 * **Speaker** : Daniel Marques
 * **What it was about** : This talk examined how AI allows threat actors to automate key phases of phishing campaigns, including initial reconnaissance, crafting targeted communications, and establishing attack infrastructure.
 * **Why it stood out** : Threat actors can now easily scale and customize phishing campaigns using AI, which was previously more challenging with manual methods.
### 📍 Zero Trust, Total Bust - Breaking into thousands of cloud-based VPNs with one bug
 * **Speaker** : David Cash & Rich Warren
 * **What it was about** : This talk highlighted how Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions were exploited to bypass authentication, spoof device posture checks, and escalate privileges.
 * **Why it stood out** : This presentation aimed to highlight the vendor flaws of Zero Trust solutions. The key takeaway is to avoid blindly trusting your Zero Trust solution; consistently monitor logs and keep your infrastructure updated.
### Villages
### 🧪 Red Team Village
 * **What I explored** : Modern red team tools and methodologies for penetration testers and red team engagements.
 * **Key insight** : I discovered some tools that I can leverage during our upcoming internal red team exercise for FedRAMP.
### 🧪 Physical Security Village
 * **What I explored** : This year I volunteered for the Physical Security Village despite having limited experience with physical penetration testing.
 * **Key insight** : I learned various lock bypass techniques and demonstrated them to other conference attendees.

## 🔒 Practical takeaways
Here are a few ideas or trends to dig into:
 * **We should consider leveraging AI more to perform log analysis.**
 * **Prompt injections will become more prevalent with LLM adoption.**
 * **AI is enabling threat actors to launch hyper personalized, convincing, and adaptive phishing campaigns.**

![A cool collection of six previous defcon badges.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/5828451e541c37769b06b52ba0661b95c2d5d62e0bc1da3df7d348bdb7a7a0e5/assets/images/blog/defcon-33-takeaways/badge-collection.png)
I am running out of space for the badges I collect each year at DEF CON. 😆
My favorite badge this year was the [Laser Tag Badge](https://www.dani.pink/lasertag/about "https://www.dani.pink/lasertag/about"). Unfortunately, my IR emitter fell off on the first day of the Con. I soldered on a new one but finished 160th on the leaderboard.
## 💭 Final thoughts
This was my fourth DEF CON and it’s always a bit overwhelming—in the best way. It’s a reminder of the creativity, curiosity, and persistence that defines the security community. Whether you’re trying to break things or protect them, it’s all about asking better questions.
