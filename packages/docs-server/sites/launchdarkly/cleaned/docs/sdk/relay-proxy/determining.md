## Overview
This category contains topics about how to decide whether to use the Relay Proxy.
We recommend using the Relay Proxy in certain situations. The Relay Proxy is not appropriate for all customer configurations.
You may want to use the Relay Proxy to:
 * reduce costs incurred by cloud providers for outbound network connections
 * improve performance when using many SDK clients on a single host
 * integrate LaunchDarkly in a PHP environment
 * reduce initialization latency in short-lived and serverless environments, or in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
 * reduce operational work when creating new projects and environments
 * increase availability in countries with strict network policies
 * reduce redundant database traffic
 * use synced segments or larger list-based segments with server-side SDKs
To learn more, read [Relay Proxy use cases](/docs/sdk/relay-proxy/use-cases).
If you decide the Relay Proxy is appropriate for your use case, you should follow our architectural and caching guidelines. To learn more, read [Relay Proxy guidelines](/docs/sdk/relay-proxy/guidelines).
