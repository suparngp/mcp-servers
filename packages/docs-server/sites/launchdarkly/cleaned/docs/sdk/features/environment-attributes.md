## Overview
This topic explains how LaunchDarkly automatically provides data about the environment where the application is running.
Some LaunchDarkly mobile SDKs support automatically providing data about the environment where the application is running. This data makes it simpler to target your mobile customers based on application name or version, or on device characteristics including manufacturer, model, operating system, locale, and so on.
When you configure your SDK, you must explicitly decide whether or not LaunchDarkly should collect and return this data. We recommend enabling this feature when you configure the SDK.
After you enable this option, the SDKs automatically add this data to each evaluation context you provide. The data is provided in two new [context kinds](/docs/home/flags/context-kinds): `ld_application` and `ld_device`. If the data is not available, it is omitted.
Customers who are [billed by MAU](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing#monthly-active-users-mau) may be charged based on the `ld_device` context kind if it becomes the context kind with the highest volume of monthly activity in their account. This feature does not affect customers on other billing models. To learn more, read [Account usage metrics](/docs/home/account/metrics).
##### Add mobile targeting rules only after environment attributes are collected
You can only create a “Mobile” targeting rule, and target mobile apps and devices based on automatically collected mobile environment attributes, if you have completed the following:
 * your feature flag has its “Available on mobile SDKs” toggle set to **On**. To learn more, read [Creating new flags](/docs/home/flags/new). LaunchDarkly accounts created after October 21, 2025 have this box checked by default.
 * you have already started to collect these attributes in the `ld_application` and `ld_device` context kinds. LaunchDarkly must receive these context kinds before it enables the option to create a mobile targeting rule. To learn more about mobile targeting rules, read [Mobile targeting](/docs/home/flags/mobile-targeting).
To use this feature, you must:
 * Use a [supported client-side SDK](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#client-side-sdks)
 * Configure your SDK to enable collection of these [environment attributes](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#about-the-automatically-added-environment-attributes)
Details about each SDK’s configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.
 * [Client-side SDKs](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#client-side-sdks)
## About the automatically added environment attributes
If you enable automatic environment attributes in the SDK client configuration, the SDK automatically adds additional contexts to each context that you evaluate. You can use attributes from these contexts in your targeting rules.
These automatically added contexts include the following attributes:
Context kind | Context attribute | Description | Examples 
---|---|---|--- 
`ld_application` | `key` | Unique for this context kind. Automatically generated by the SDK. One of LaunchDarkly’s standard [built-in attributes](/docs/home/flags/built-in-attributes). | _randomly generated_ 
| `id` | Unique identifier of the application. | `com.launchdarkly.example` 
| `locale` | Locale of the device, in [IETF BCP 47 Language Tag](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) format. | `en-US` 
| `name` | Human-friendly name of the application. One of LaunchDarkly’s standard [built-in attributes](/docs/home/flags/built-in-attributes). | `Example Mobile App` 
| `version` | Version of the application used for update comparison. | `5`, `1.2.3` 
| `versionName` | Human-friendly name of the version. May or may not be a semantic version. | `5`, `1.2` 
| `envAttributesVersion` | Version of the environment attributes schema being used. This may change in later versions of the SDK. | `1.0` 
`ld_device` | `key` | Unique for this context kind. Automatically generated by the SDK. May be regenerated in some cases, for example, if a customer uninstalls and then re-installs the application, or if a customer purchases a new device and doesn’t restore the device from their prior device’s backup. One of LaunchDarkly’s standard [built-in attributes](/docs/home/flags/built-in-attributes). | _randomly generated_ 
| `manufacturer` | Manufacturer of the device. | `Google`, `Apple` 
| `model` | Model of the device. | `Pixel 6 Pro`, `iPhone`, `iPhone10,3`, `iPad` 
| `os` | Operating system of the device. Includes properties for `family`, `name`, and `version`. | 
 * `family`: `Android`, `Apple`
 * `version`: `13`, `16.2`
 * `name`: `Android`, `Android33`, `iOS`
| `envAttributesVersion` | Version of the environment attributes schema being used. This may change in later versions of the SDK. | `1.0` 
##### Working with multi-contexts
When you enable environment attributes, the SDK automatically adds the `ld_application` and `ld_device` contexts to the evaluation context that you pass to [`variation` calls](/docs/sdk/features/evaluating).
This means every evaluation context is now a set of multiple contexts, which is called a multi-context. You can create targeting rules in your feature flags based on data from multiple contexts at the same time. To learn more, read [Multi-contexts](/docs/home/flags/multi-contexts).
If the LaunchDarkly SDK you are using does not support environment attributes, you can create a multi-context yourself when you construct the evaluation context. You can include similar attributes as are included in the environment attributes feature, if you have access to them from your application, or you can include others. However, you must use the environment attributes feature in order to create [mobile targeting rules](/docs/home/flags/mobile-targeting).
If the SDK cannot determine the information for a particular attribute, it will not include that attribute. For example, if the SDK cannot determine the device’s model, it will not include the `model` attribute.
If the SDK can determine none of the information for an entire context, it will not include that context. For example, if you run the .NET (client-side) SDK on a desktop environment, the SDK cannot reliably get the device information. In this case the `ld_device` context is omitted.
### Automatic environment attributes and application metadata configuration
If you are already setting [application metadata](/docs/sdk/features/app-config) as part of your SDK configuration, you can still use the [environment attributes](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes) feature. Any application metadata that you set will override the automatically collected environment attributes.
Specifically, if you enable automatic environment attributes, then the `ld_application` context attributes are set based on the following priority order:
 1. If you set values for application id, name, version, or version name using [application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config) in the SDK, then the `ld_application` context will reflect those values.
 2. Otherwise, if you have set values for the application id, name, version, or version name within your mobile app, the `ld_application` context will reflect those values.
 3. Otherwise, the `ld_application` context will use the LaunchDarkly SDK name and version.
##### Ensure your application identifier is unique per distributed application
We recommend that you set the application identifier to a different value for each separately distributed software binary.
For example, suppose you have two mobile apps, one for iOS and one for Android. If you set the application identifier to “example-app” and the version to “1.0” in both SDKs, then when you create a flag targeting rule based only on application information, the flag will target both the iOS and Android application. This may not be what you intend.
We recommend using different application identifiers in this situation, for instance, by setting “example-app-ios” and “example-app-android” in your [application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config). Alternatively, you can create flag targeting rules based on a combination of the `ld_application` information and the `ld_device` information.
## Client-side SDKs
This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:
 * [.NET (client-side)](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#net-client-side)
 * [Android](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#android)
 * [Flutter](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#flutter)
 * [iOS](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#ios)
 * [React Native](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes#react-native)
### .NET (client-side)
###### Expand .NET (client-side) code sample
This feature is available in v4 and later of the .NET (client-side) SDK.
##### .NET (client-side) SDK returns different values in v4 and v5
After you upgrade from version 4 to version 5 of the LaunchDarkly .NET (client-side) SDK, the SDK returns different values for some of the environment attributes:
 * For Android, the `ld_device` attribute `os/name` now returns only the name. For example, the version 5 SDK returns `Android`, while the version 4 SDK returns `Android28` or similar. Use the `ld_device` attribute `os/version` to access the version information.
 * For iOS, the `ld_device` attribute `model` now returns model numbers in some cases. For example, the version 5 SDK returns `iPad5,2` or `iPhone10,3`, while the version 4 SDK returns `iPad` or `iPhone`.
 * For iOS, the `ld_application` attribute `name` is populated as follows:
 * `ld_application.name` returns the `name` that you set using [application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config) in the SDK, if any.
 * If that is not set, then the version 5 SDK returns the `CFBundleDisplayName` if defined. Otherwise, it returns the `CFBundleName`. This is a change in behavior. The version 4 SDK always returns the `CFBundleName`.
 * If that is not set, `ld_application.name` returns the LaunchDarkly SDK name and version.
Because of these changes, you should check your [mobile targeting rules](/docs/home/flags/mobile-targeting) carefully after you upgrade your SDK. To learn more about upgrading, read [.NET (client-side) SDK 4.x to 5.0 migration guide](/docs/sdk/client-side/dotnet/migration-4-to-5).
This code sample shows you how to configure the SDK to record environment attributes from an end user’s mobile device:
.NET SDK v4+ (C#)
```
1
| var config = Configuration
---|--- 
2
| .Builder("mobile-key-123abc", ConfigurationBuilder.AutoEnvAttributes.Enabled)
3
| .Build();
```
To disable this option, pass in `AutoEnvAttributes.Disabled` instead.

##### Set application metadata to include ld_application
In version 10 of the React Native SDK, the `ld_application` context is only included if you set the application id using [application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config#react-native) when you construct the client. The SDK does not automatically populate the `ld_application` context with values from your mobile app or from the SDK itself.
