## Overview
This topic explains how to enable OpenTelemetry in client-side SDKs, using the LaunchDarkly observability plugins. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTel) is an open source observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs.
##### Looking for information on OpenTelemetry in server-side SDKs?
For information on using OpenTelemetry in LaunchDarkly’s server-side SDKs, read [OpenTelemetry in server-side SDKs](/docs/sdk/features/opentelemetry-server-side).
## Viewing OpenTelemetry data in LaunchDarkly
In the LaunchDarkly UI, OpenTelemetry data is used in the [observability](/docs/home/observability), [Experimentation](/docs/home/experimentation), [feature monitoring](/docs/home/releases/feature-monitoring), and [guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts) features.
When LaunchDarkly receives OpenTelemetry trace data, it processes and converts this data into events that LaunchDarkly metrics track over time. In particular, when you are working with client-side SDKs, the LaunchDarkly [observability SDKs](/docs/sdk/observability) provide error monitoring and metric collection for errors, web vitals, and document loading in your browser application. To learn more, read [Metrics autogenerated from observability events](/docs/home/metrics/autogen-metrics#metrics-autogenerated-from-observability-events).
## Sending OpenTelemetry data to LaunchDarkly
When you use one of the LaunchDarkly client-side SDKs, LaunchDarkly automatically ingests OTel data if you are using one of the [observability SDKs](/docs/sdk/observability). These are implemented as plugins that you can configure as part of initializing the client-side SDK.
The SDKs send this data to LaunchDarkly at the following endpoints:
 * `https://otel.observability.app.launchdarkly.com/v1/traces`
 * `https://otel.observability.app.launchdarkly.com/v1/logs`
 * `https://otel.observability.app.launchdarkly.com/v1/metrics`
You may need to update your infrastructure to make sure the SDK can reach this domain. To learn more, read [Accessing LaunchDarkly by domain](/docs/sdk/concepts/domain-list#accessing-launchdarkly-by-domain).
