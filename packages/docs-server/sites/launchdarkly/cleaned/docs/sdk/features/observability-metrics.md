## Overview
The observability plugin provides different functions depending on what kind of data you want to record.
The recorded data is available as an `$ld:telemetry:metric` event. To learn more, read [Metrics autogenerated from observability events](/docs/home/metrics/autogen-metrics#metrics-autogenerated-from-observability-events).
You can view all metrics sent to LaunchDarkly under **Metrics** in the LaunchDarkly user interface. To learn more, read [Metrics](/docs/home/metrics).
Details about each SDK’s configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below:
 * [Client-side SDKs](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#client-side-sdks)
 * [Server-side SDKs](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#server-side-sdks)
## Client-side SDKs
This feature is available in the observability plugin for the following client-side SDKs:
 * [iOS](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#ios)
 * [Android](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#android)
 * [JavaScript](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#javascript)
 * [React Native](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#react-native)
 * [React Web](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#react-web)
 * [Vue](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#vue)
### iOS
###### Expand iOS code sample
When you record a metric with the observability plugin, it must include a `name` and `value`. Optionally, it can also include `attributes` and a `timestamp`. To construct the attributes, use `Attributes` from the [`@opentelemetry/api`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attributes/).
Here are the options for recording metrics:
Record point-in-timeRecord cumulative countRecord cumulative incrementRecord point-in-time, aggregate to histogramRecord counter
```
1
| LDObserve.shared.recordMetric(metric: .init(name: "elapsedTimeMs", value: 2200))
---|--- 
```
To learn more, read [`Observe`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/swift-launchdarkly-observability/blob/main/Sources/LaunchDarklyObservability/API/Observe.swift).

### React Native
###### Expand React Native code sample
When you record a metric with the observability plugin, it must include a `name` and `value`. Optionally, it can also include `attributes` and a `timestamp`. To construct the attributes, use `Attributes` from the [`@opentelemetry/api`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attributes/).

### React Web
To record metrics with the React Web SDK, follow the example for [JavaScript](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#javascript).
### Vue
To record metrics with the Vue SDK, follow the example for [JavaScript](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#javascript).
## Server-side SDKs
This feature is available in the observability plugin for the following server-side SDKs:
 * [.NET (server-side)](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#net-server-side)
 * [Go](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#go)
 * [Node.js (server-side)](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#nodejs-server-side)
 * [Python](/docs/sdk/features/observability-metrics#python)
### .NET (server-side)
###### Expand .NET (server-side) code sample
Here are the options for recording metrics:
Record point-in-timeRecord cumulative countRecord cumulative incrementRecord point-in-time, aggregate to histogramRecord counter
```
1
| Observe.RecordMetric(name, value, attributes);
---|--- 
```
To learn more, read [`Observe`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/observability-sdk/sdk/@launchdarkly/observability-dotnet/api/LaunchDarkly.Observability.Observe.html).
### Go
###### Expand Go code sample
To record a metric, pass the Go `context.Context`, as well as the name, value, and optional attributes of the metric to the appropriate `Record*` function. For example, you might want to record the value for a point-in-time measurement, such as the current CPU utilization percentage, or for a counter, such as the number of cache hits. The optional attributes may include any [attributes from the OpenTelemetry specification](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute#KeyValue).
Metrics with the same name and attributes are aggregated using the OpenTelemetry SDK. To learn more, read the OTel documentation on the [Metrics Data Model](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/).
Here are the options for recording metrics:
Record point-in-timeRecord cumulative countRecord point-in-time, aggregate to histogram
```

| ldobserve.RecordMetric(ctx, "example-metric-name", 3.7)
---|--- 
```
To learn more, read [`RecordMetric`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/observability-sdk/go#RecordMetric), [`RecordCount`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/observability-sdk/go#RecordCount), and [`RecordHistogram`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/observability-sdk/go#RecordHistogram).
### Node.js (server-side)
###### Expand Node.js (server-side) code sample
To record a metric, first create the metric within your application. The `Metric` interface includes a `name`, `value`, and optional `tags`. For example, you might create a metric for a point-in-time measurement, such as the current CPU utilization percentage, or for a counter, such as the number of cache hits.
Values with the same metric name and attributes are aggregated using the OpenTelemetry SDK. To learn more, read the OTel documentation on the [Metrics Data Model](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/).
Create OTel metric
```
1
| const metric = {
---|--- 
2
| name: "exampleMetric",
3
| value: 42
4
| }
```
Here are the options for recording metrics:
Record point-in-timeRecord cumulative countRecord cumulative incrementRecord point-in-time, aggregate to histogramRecord counter
```
1
| LDObserve.recordMetric(metric);
---|--- 
```
To learn more, read [`Observe`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/observability-sdk/sdk/@launchdarkly/observability-node/interfaces/Observe.html).
### Python
###### Expand Python code sample
To record a metric, pass the name, value, and optional attributes to the appropriate `record_*` function. For example, you might want to record the value for a point-in-time measurement, such as the current CPU utilization percentage, or for a counter, such as the number of cache hits. The optional attributes may include any [attributes from the OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attributes/).
