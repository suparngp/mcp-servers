## Overview
This topic documents how to get started with the server-side Node.js SDK. It also links to reference information for all of the features the server-side Node.js SDK supports.

##### For use in server-side applications only
This SDK is intended for use in multi-user Node.js server applications. If you want to set up LaunchDarkly in JavaScript in a browser environment, read the [JavaScript SDK reference](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript). If you’re creating a client-side Node application, read the [Node.js SDK reference (client-side)](/docs/sdk/client-side/node-js). If you’re creating a desktop application in Electron, read the [Electron SDK reference](/docs/sdk/client-side/electron).
To learn more about LaunchDarkly’s different SDK types, read [Choosing an SDK type](/docs/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).
The sample code snippets for this SDK are available in both JavaScript and TypeScript, where the sample code differs. To learn more, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).
## Get started
After you complete the [Getting Started process](/docs/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Node.js application.
### Install the SDK
First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application’s dependency manager.
We recommend making the LaunchDarkly [observability plugin](/docs/sdk/observability) available as well. This plugin collects and sends observability data to LaunchDarkly, including [metrics autogenerated from OpenTelemetry data](/docs/home/metrics/autogen-metrics#metrics-autogenerated-from-opentelemetry-data). This means you can review error monitoring, logs, and traces from within the LaunchDarkly UI. They require the Node.js (server-side) SDK version 9.10 or later.
Here’s how:
shell
```
$
| npm install @launchdarkly/node-server-sdk
---|--- 
>
| 
>
| # optional observability plugin, requires Node.js (server-side) SDK v9.10+
>
| npm install @launchdarkly/observability-node
>
| 
>
| # In earlier versions, the package name was launchdarkly-node-server-sdk or ldclient-node
```
Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:
Node.js SDK v8.x+Node.js SDK v7.x
```
1
| import { init, LDContext, LDOptions } from '@launchdarkly/node-server-sdk';
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| // optional observability plugin, requires Node.js (server-side) SDK v9.10+
4
| import { Observability } from "@launchdarkly/observability-node";
```
##### The Node.js (server-side) SDK uses an SDK key
The Node.js (server-side) SDK uses an SDK key. Keys are specific to each project and environment. They are available from **Project settings** , on the **Environments** list. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/docs/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).
### Initialize the client
After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.
Here’s how:
Node.js SDK
```
1
| const client = init(
---|--- 
2
| 'sdk-key-123abc'
3
| {
4
| // optional observability plugin, requires Node.js (server-side) SDK v9.10+
5
| plugins: [ new Observability(), ],
6
| // other options
7
| },
8
| );
```
To learn more about the specific configuration options available in this SDK, read [`LDOptions`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-core/packages/sdk/server-node/docs/interfaces/LDOptions.html).
##### LDClient must be a singleton
It’s important to make `LDClient` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains internal state that allows us to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.
If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `LDClient` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.
The client emits a `ready` event when you initialize it and it can serve feature flags.
### Evaluate a context
Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag. The `ready` event is only emitted once, when you first initialize the client. In a production application, place your `client.variation` code so that it is invoked as needed.
Here is an example:
Node.js SDK v7.x and later (JavaScript)Node.js SDK v7.x and later (TypeScript)
```
1
| const context = {
---|--- 
2
| "kind": 'user',
3
| "key": 'user-key-123abc',
4
| "name": 'Sandy'
5
| };
6
| 
7
| client.on('ready', () => {
8
| client.variation('flag-key-123abc', context, false,
9
| (err, showFeature) => {
10
| if (showFeature) {
11
| // application code to show the feature
12
| } else {
13
| // the code to run if the feature is off
14
| }
15
| });
16
| });
```
## Promises and async
All asynchronous SDK methods which accept a callback also return a `Promise`. This means that if your application uses promises to manage asynchronous operations, interacting with the SDK should be convenient. Because the `async/await` syntax is based on Promises, these methods also work with `await`.
Here is an example:
Node.js SDK v7.x and later (JavaScript)Node.js SDK v7.x and later (TypeScript)
```
1
| // Using the .then() method to add a continuation handler for a Promise
---|--- 
2
| client.variation('flag-key-123abc', context, false).then((value) => {
3
| // application code
4
| });
5
| 
6
| // Using "await" instead, within an async function
7
| const value = await client.variation('flag-key-123abc', context, false);
```
There is also an alternative to the `ready` event:
JavaScript
```
1
| // Using .then() and .catch() to add success and error handlers to a Promise
---|--- 
2
| client.waitForInitialization({timeout: 10}).then((client) => {
3
| // initialization complete
4
| }).catch((err) => {
5
| // timeout or initialization failed
6
| });
7
| 
8
| // Using "await" instead, within an async function
9
| try {
10
| await client.waitForInitialization({timeout: 10});
11
| // initialization complete
12
| } catch (err) {
13
| // timeout or initialization failed
14
| }
```
`allFlagsState` and `flush` also return a `Promise`.
##### Do not wait for a Promise indefinitely
There is no built-in timeout for this method. Instead, we recommend using [`Promise.race()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race) for your code to stop waiting on the Promise after a set amount of time. Regardless of whether you continue to wait, the SDK will still retry all connection failures indefinitely unless it gets an unrecoverable error.
## Shut down the client
Shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/docs/sdk/features/shutdown#nodejs-server-side).
Unlike other LaunchDarkly SDKs, the Node.js (server-side) SDK does not automatically send pending analytics events to LaunchDarkly when it shuts down. To send analytics events, you first need to call [flush](/docs/sdk/features/flush#nodejs-server-side).
