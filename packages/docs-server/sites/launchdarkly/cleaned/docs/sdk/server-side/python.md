## Overview
This topic documents how to get started with the Python SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.
##### SDK quick links
LaunchDarkly’s SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and sample applications:
Resource | Location 
---|--- 
SDK API documentation | [SDK API docs](https://launchdarkly-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/) 
GitHub repository | [python-server-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/python-server-sdk) 
Sample applications | [Python](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-python) 
[R](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-r) 
Published module | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/launchdarkly-server-sdk/) 
##### SDK version compatibility
The LaunchDarkly Python SDK, version 9.0 through 9.11, is compatible with Python 3.8.0 and higher. Starting with version 9.12, the SDK requires Python 3.9.0 or higher.
## Get started
After you complete the [Getting Started process](/docs/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Python application.
### Install the SDK
First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application’s dependency manager. If you want to depend on a specific version, refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/python-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version.
We recommend making the LaunchDarkly [observability plugin](/docs/sdk/observability) available as well. This plugin collects and sends observability data to LaunchDarkly, including [metrics autogenerated from OpenTelemetry data](/docs/home/metrics/autogen-metrics#metrics-autogenerated-from-opentelemetry-data). This means you can review error monitoring, logs, and traces from within the LaunchDarkly UI. They require the Python SDK version 9.12 or later.
Here’s how:
Shell
```
$
| pip install launchdarkly-server-sdk
---|--- 
>
| 
>
| # optional observability plugin, requires Python SDK v9.12+
>
| pip install launchdarkly-observability
```
Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:
Python
```
1
| import ldclient
---|--- 
2
| from ldclient.config import Config
3
| 
4
| # optional observability plugin, requires Python SDK v9.12+
5
| import ldobserve
6
| from ldobserve import ObservabilityConfig, ObservabilityPlugin, observe
```
##### The Python SDK uses an SDK key
The Python SDK uses an SDK key. Keys are specific to each project and environment. They are available from **Project settings** , on the **Environments** list. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/docs/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).
### Initialize the client
After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `ldclient`. Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.
The `get()` function enforces the singleton pattern. You should only have one instance of the client in your application.
##### ldclient must be a singleton
It’s important to make `ldclient` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.
If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `LDClient` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.
Only create one instance of `client`.
Here’s how:
Python
```
1
| ldclient.set_config(Config("sdk-key-123abc",
---|--- 
2
| # optional observability plugin, requires Python SDK v9.12+
3
| plugins=[ObservabilityPlugin()]
4
| )
5
| )
6
| client = ldclient.get()
```
##### Worker-based servers require specific setup
The Python SDK uses multiple background threads to operate correctly. If the SDK is deployed to an environment which forks from the main process, the SDK may not operate as expected. To learn more about this problem and how to fix it, refer to [Considerations with worker-based servers](/docs/sdk/server-side/python#considerations-with-worker-based-servers), below.
### Evaluate a context
You can use `client` to check which variation a particular context will receive for a given feature flag. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/docs/sdk/features/evaluating) and [Flag evaluation reasons](/docs/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons). For more information about how contexts are specified, read [Context configuration](/docs/sdk/features/context-config).
In the v8.0 example, the context key is the string “context-key-123abc”. In the v7.x example, the user key is the string “user-key-123abc”:
Python SDK v8.0+
```
1
| from ldclient import Context
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| context = Context.builder("context-key-123abc").name("Sandy").build()
4
| flag_value = client.variation("flag-key-123abc", context, False)
5
| 
6
| if flag_value:
7
| # application code to show the feature
8
| else:
9
| # the code to run if the feature is off
```
## Considerations with worker-based servers
The LaunchDarkly SDK relies on multiple threads to operate correctly. These threads provide essential functionality, including delivering flag updates and sending event data.
If the main process which instantiated the SDK is itself forked, the SDK will still evaluate flags, but it will be unable to receive changes to those flags in that child process. This is because threads do not survive the forking process in Python.
The good news is the LaunchDarkly SDK _is_ compatible with worker-based servers. However, there are a few considerations:
 * You should initialize a new client before the forking process.
 * After you have forked the worker process, you can call `postfork()` to reinitialize the client. This way, your client will accurately reflect flag changes in the forked thread.
Here’s how:
Python SDK v9.11+
```
1
| # 1. Create the client before forking.
---|--- 
2
| ldclient.set_config(Config("sdk-key-123abc"))
3
| client = ldclient.get()
4
| 
5
| # 2. From the newly forked process, reinitialize the client by calling `postfork`.
6
| # Examples for specific servers are shown below.
7
| client.postfork()
```
Any configuration that you provide to the SDK must survive the forking process independently. We recommend that you add any [listeners](/docs/sdk/features/monitoring#python) or [hooks](/docs/sdk/features/hooks#python) after the `postfork()` call, unless you are certain they can survive the forking process.
If you are using the [Relay Proxy](/docs/sdk/relay-proxy), you must use Relay Proxy v8.11 or later to use `postfork()`.
To learn more about the specific configuration options available in this SDK, read [`ldclient.config`](https://launchdarkly-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-main.html#module-ldclient.config). To learn more about the `postfork()` reinitialization, read [`ldclient.postfork`](https://launchdarkly-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-main.html#ldclient.client.LDClient.postfork).
### Example: Configure uWSGI
In uWSGI environments, you must set the `enable-threads` option. After `uwsgi` has forked the worker process, you can call `postfork()` to reinitialize the client. You can do this using `uwsgidecorators`.
Here’s how:
Python uWSGI initialization
```
1
| import uwsgidecorators
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| # Instantiate the client before the fork
4
| ldclient.set_config(LDConfig("sdk-key-123abc"))
5
| client = ldclient.get()
6
| 
7
| @uwsgidecorators.postfork
8
| def post_fork_client_initialization():
9
| # Reinitialize the client after the fork
10
| ldclient.get().postfork()
```
## HTTPS proxy
Python’s standard HTTP library provides a built-in HTTPS proxy. If the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable is present, then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.
Here’s how to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Mac/Linux systems:
Shell
```
$
| export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
---|--- 
```
Here’s how to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Windows systems:
cmd
```
$
| set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
---|--- 
```
Here’s how to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable from within Python:
Python
```
1
| os.environ["HTTPS_PROXY"] = "https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080"
---|--- 
```

Shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/docs/sdk/features/shutdown#python).
