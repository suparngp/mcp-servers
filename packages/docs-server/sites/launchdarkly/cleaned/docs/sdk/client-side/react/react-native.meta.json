Version 10 is a rewrite of the React Native SDK. It is based on the JavaScript SDK, and it replaces [launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-native-client-sdk). To learn more about upgrading, read [React Native SDK 9.x to 10.0 migration guide](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/migration-9-to-10-react-native)."
