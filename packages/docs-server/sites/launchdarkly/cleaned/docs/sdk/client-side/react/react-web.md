##### The React Web SDK does not work in React Native projects
If you want to add LaunchDarkly to your React Native codebase, use the React Native SDK instead. The React Web SDK is intended for use in web applications, and the React Native SDK is specifically designed to run in mobile environments. To learn more, read [React Native SDK](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-native).
## Overview
This topic documents how to get started with the client-side React Web SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.
##### SDK quick links
LaunchDarkly’s SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:
Resource | Location 
---|--- 
SDK API documentation | [SDK API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/) 
GitHub repository | [react-client-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk) 
Sample application | [React Web](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#example-app) 
Published module | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/launchdarkly-react-client-sdk) 
## Get started
After you complete the [Get started](/docs/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly React Web SDK in your React code:
 * [Understand version compatibility](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#understand-version-compatibility)
 * [Install the SDK](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#install-the-sdk)
 * [Initialize the client](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#initialize-the-client)
 * [Identify the context](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#identify-the-context)
 * [Subscribe to flag changes](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#subscribe-to-flag-changes)
 * [Access flag values](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#access-flag-values)
### Understand version compatibility
The React Web SDK is based on the JavaScript SDK. The React Web SDK builds on LaunchDarkly’s JavaScript SDK to provide a better integration for use in React applications. As a result, much of the JavaScript SDK functionality is also available for the React Web SDK to use. For a complete client-side JavaScript SDK reference, read [JavaScript SDK reference](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript).
The LaunchDarkly React Web SDK versions 3.0 and higher are compatible with React version 16.3.3 and higher.
The LaunchDarkly React Web SDK versions 2.x are compatible with React version 16.3.0 and higher.
The LaunchDarkly React Web SDK offers two custom hooks. If you want to use these, then you must use React version 16.8.0 or higher. To learn more, read [Hooks](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#hooks).
The LaunchDarkly React Web SDK version 3.0.0 uses optional chaining. If you encounter an error related to optional chaining during transpiling, bundling, or running tests, updating to version 3.0.2 should resolve the error.
### Install the SDK
Install the React Web SDK using either `npm` or `yarn`.
We recommend making the LaunchDarkly [observability plugins](/docs/sdk/observability) available as well. These plugins collect and send observability data to LaunchDarkly, including [metrics autogenerated from observability events](/docs/home/metrics/autogen-metrics#metrics-autogenerated-from-observability-events). This means you can review session replay, error monitoring, logs, and traces from within the LaunchDarkly UI. They require the React Web SDK version 3.7 or later.
Here’s how:
Installing with npmInstalling with yarn
```
$
| npm install launchdarkly-react-client-sdk
---|--- 
>
| npm install @launchdarkly/observability # optional observability plugin
>
| npm install @launchdarkly/session-replay # optional session replay plugin
```
### Initialize the client
After you install the dependency, your code must initialize the React Web SDK before it can evaluate flags. You can do this in one of two ways:
 * To render your app only after SDK initialization is complete, use `await` with `asyncWithLDProvider`
 * To render your app first, and then initialize the SDK and process flag updates after rendering is complete, use `withLDProvider`
Both functions rely on React’s `Context` API, which lets you access your flags from any level of your component hierarchy. The React `Context` API is unrelated to [LaunchDarkly contexts](/docs/home/flags/contexts).
To initialize the React Web SDK, you need your LaunchDarkly environment’s client-side ID and the context for which you want to evaluate flags. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.
We recommend making the LaunchDarkly [observability plugins](/docs/sdk/observability) available as well, as shown in the configuration options below.
##### React Web SDK credentials
The React Web SDK requires a client-side ID. Client-side IDs are specific to each project and environment. They are not secret, and you can include them in client-side code. Do not embed a server-side SDK key in a client-side application. You can find client-side IDs and project keys in **Project settings** , on the **Environments** list. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/docs/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).
If you connect the React Web SDK to the ldcli dev-server for local testing, use your project key instead of a client-side ID. Set all service endpoints to `http://localhost:8765`. If you use a client-side ID, the SDK connects to LaunchDarkly rather than the dev-server, which can result in CORS errors.
###### Expand Initialize using asyncWithLDProvider
#### Initialize using `asyncWithLDProvider`
The `asyncWithLDProvider` function initializes the React Web SDK and returns a `Context.Provider`, which is a React component. It is an asynchronous function.
You must initialize `asyncWithLDProvider` at the app entry point, prior to rendering, to ensure that flags and the LaunchDarkly client are ready at the start of your React app lifecycle.
If you use the `asyncWithLDProvider` function with `await`, the rendering of your React app is delayed until SDK initialization completes. Depending on your network conditions, this may take a couple hundred milliseconds. After initialization is complete, your flags and the LaunchDarkly client become available at the start of your React app lifecycle. This ensures that your app does not [flicker due to flag changes at startup time](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript/default-values). To learn more, read [Initialize using the `asyncWithLDProvider` function](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#initialize-using-asyncwithldprovider), below.
The `asyncWithLDProvider` function accepts an `AsyncProviderConfig` object, which provides configuration options for the React Web SDK. To learn more, read [Configure options](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#configuration-options), below. One of these configuration options is the `options` field, which lets you customize your client. To learn more, read about [Configuration](/docs/sdk/features/config#javascript) for the JavaScript SDK.
Here’s how to initialize using `asyncWithLDProvider`:
React Web SDK v3.x
```
1
| import { asyncWithLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';
---|--- 
2
| import Observability from '@launchdarkly/observability';
3
| import SessionReplay from '@launchdarkly/session-replay';
4
| 
5
| (async () => {
6
| const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({
7
| clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
8
| context: {
9
| "kind": "user",
10
| "key": "user-key-123abc",
11
| "name": "Sandy Smith",
12
| "email": "sandy@example.com"
13
| },
14
| options: {
15
| // the observability plugins require React Web SDK v3.7+
16
| plugins: [
17
| new Observability(),
18
| new SessionReplay()
19
| ],
20
| // other options...
21
| }
22
| });
23
| 
24
| render(
25
| <LDProvider>
26
| <YourApp />
27
| </LDProvider>,
28
| document.getElementById('reactDiv'),
29
| );
30
| })();
```
##### This function requires React 16.8.0 or later
The `asyncWithLDProvider` function uses the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.
###### Expand Initialize using withLDProvider
#### Initialize using `withLDProvider`
The `withLDProvider` function initializes the React Web SDK and wraps your root component in a `Context.Provider`, which is a React component. It initializes the underlying JavaScript SDK at `componentDidMount`. This means your flags and the LaunchDarkly client only become available after your app has mounted.
You can also optionally defer initialization further, until after you define a context. Because your app renders before initialization, using `withLDProvider` can result in a flicker due to flag changes at startup time.
The `withLDProvider` function accepts a [`ProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/interfaces/ProviderConfig.html) object, which provides configuration properties for the React SDK:
 * The `clientSideID` is required.
 * In the example below, the `context` property is specified. Alternatively, you could set the `deferInitialization` property, and defer initialization until after you define the context property.
 * The `options` field lets you customize your client. To learn more, read about [Configuration](/docs/sdk/features/config#javascript) for the JavaScript SDK.
Here’s how to initialize using `withLDProvider`:
React Web SDK v3.x
```
1
| import { render } from 'react-dom';
---|--- 
2
| import { withLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';
3
| import Observability from '@launchdarkly/observability';
4
| import SessionReplay from '@launchdarkly/session-replay';
5
| 
6
| import App from './App';
7
| 
8
| const LDProvider = withLDProvider({
9
| clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
10
| context: {
11
| "kind": "user",
12
| "key": "user-key-123abc",
13
| "name": "Sandy Smith",
14
| "email": "sandy@example.com"
15
| },
16
| options: {
17
| // the observability plugins require React Web SDK v3.7+
18
| plugins: [
19
| new Observability(),
20
| new SessionReplay()
21
| ],
22
| // other options...
23
| }
24
| })(App);
25
| 
26
| const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
27
| render(<LDProvider />, rootElement);
```
After initialization is complete, your flags and the client are only available after your app has mounted. Use this method if you prefer to render your app first, and then process flag updates after rendering is complete.
### Identify the context
After initialization is complete, your flags and the client are available at the start of your React app lifecycle. This ensures your app does not flicker due to flag changes at startup time.
If your app does not yet have the context when you initialize, you can omit the `context` option. This instantiates the client without explicitly specifying a context. Instead, the React Web SDK uses an anonymous context. Later, when you have the context, you can call `identify`.
Here’s how to identify the context after initialization:
JavaScript: app.jsJavaScript: index.js
```
1
| // app.js
---|--- 
2
| import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
3
| import { useFlags, useLDClient } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';
4
| 
5
| export default function App {
6
| const flags = useFlags();
7
| const ldClient = useLDClient();
8
| 
9
| useEffect(() => {
10
| ldClient.identify({ key: 'context-key-123abc' });
11
| }, []);
12
| 
13
| return <div>Let your feature flags fly!</div>
14
| }
```
This example uses `asyncWithLDProvider`, but you can also omit the `context` option when you initialize using `withLDProvider` and then identify the context after initialization. To learn more, read [Identifying and changing contexts](/docs/sdk/features/identify#react).
Omitting the kind creates a user object, not a context
If you omit the `kind` attribute when you create or identify a context, then LaunchDarkly will assume the context kind is “user” when evaluating flags. Additionally, the SDK will assume you are working with a user object, rather than a context.
Overall, this should make your upgrade from v2.x to v3.x easier, because your existing code will continue to work, as long as you don’t make changes to your flag configuration or [bucket users based on the “secondary” attribute](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript/migration-2-to-3#removing-the-secondary-attribute).
However, if you are using version 3.0 of the SDK and you are omitting the `kind` attribute, then the following caveats apply:
 * The fields in your user object must be `LDUser` fields, not `LDContext` fields. For example, to mark an attribute as private, you must use `privateAttributeNames` in the user object, not `_meta.privateAttributes` as you would for a context object. To learn more, read [Understanding changes to private attributes](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript/migration-2-to-3#understanding-changes-to-private-attributes).
 * Any additional attributes in your user object need to be inside the `custom` property of the `LDUser`, not at the top-level as they would in a context object. To learn more, read [Working with built-in and custom attributes](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript/migration-2-to-3#working-with-built-in-and-custom-attributes).
We strongly recommend upgrading your SDK to v3.x to take advantage of the context functionality.
### Subscribe to flag changes
The React Web SDK automatically subscribes to flag `change` events after your app has mounted, which opens a streaming connection.
In some cases, streaming may not be necessary. For example, if you reload your entire application on each update, you will get all the flag values again when the client is re-initialized. In this situation, we recommend disabling streaming mode. To disable streaming mode, specify a `streaming: false` attribute in your `options` object. When streaming is disabled, no live updates occur.
In other cases, streaming may be required. Subscribing to streaming is the only way to receive real-time updates. If you determine that streaming is necessary for your application, we recommend explicitly enabling streaming mode. To enable streaming mode, specify a `streaming: true` attribute in your `options` object.
This behavior is different from the JavaScript SDK, where you need to opt in to event listening. To learn more about how the JavaScript SDK handles flag change events, read [Subscribing to flag changes](/docs/sdk/features/flag-changes#javascript).
### Access flag values
After your code has initialized the React Web SDK, use `withLDConsumer` to access flag values and the LaunchDarkly client. The return value of `withLDConsumer` is a wrapper function that takes your component and returns a React component injected with `flags` and `ldClient` as props. Make sure to check the `error` state property, which is passed into any component that uses [`withLDConsumer`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/functions/withLDConsumer.html).
Here’s how:
JavaScript
```
1
| import { withLDConsumer } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| const Home = ({ flags, ldClient /*, ...otherProps */ }) => {
4
| 
5
| // You can call any of the methods from the JavaScript SDK
6
| // ldClient.identify({...})
7
| 
8
| return flags.devTestFlag ? <div>Flag on</div> : <div>Flag off</div>;
9
| };
10
| 
11
| export default withLDConsumer()(Home);
```
##### Making feature flags available to this SDK
You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the context will receive the fallback value for that flag.
To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or toggle on the option in the flag’s right sidebar. To make all of a project’s flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox on your project’s [Flag settings page](/docs/home/account/edit-project).
## Configuration options
The [`AsyncProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/types/AsyncProviderConfig.html) object specifies configuration for the `asyncWithLDProvider` function and the [`ProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/interfaces/ProviderConfig.html) object specifies configuration for the `withLDProvider` function.
The only difference between `AsyncProviderConfig` and `ProviderConfig` is that `AsyncProviderConfig` does not have the `deferInitialization` property, because `asyncWithLDProvider` cannot be deferred. You must initialize `asyncWithLDProvider` at the app entry point prior to rendering to ensure flags and the client are ready at the start of your React app lifecycle.
The only mandatory property is the client-side ID. All other properties are optional.
These are the properties:
 * `clientSideID`: This is your project and environment specific client-side ID. This property is mandatory.
 * `context`: A LaunchDarkly [context](/docs/home/flags/contexts) object. This property is optional unless you are initializing in secure mode, in which case it is mandatory. Defaults to an anonymous user.
 * `options`: The LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK initialization [options](/docs/sdk/features/config#javascript). This property is optional.
 * `reactOptions`: This property is specific to the React Web SDK. You can use this option to [disable automatic camel casing](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#flag-keys-in-the-react-web-sdk) of flag keys when using the React Web SDK, or to [disable evaluation events on read](/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#events). This property is optional.
 * `deferInitialization`: This property allows you to defer SDK initialization until you define the `context` property. This property is optional, and is only available in `ProviderConfig`, when you initialize using `withLDProvider`.
 * `timeout`:The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the SDK to initialize. This gets passed to the underlying Javascript SDK `waitForInitialization` function. We strongly recommend setting a value of 1-5 seconds. To learn more, read [Initialize the client](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript#initialize-the-client) in the JavaScript SDK reference.
By deferring SDK initialization, you defer all steps which take place as part of SDK initialization, including reading flag values from local storage and sending the SDK’s `ready` event.
However, even if you defer SDK initialization, the SDK continues to load bootstrapped flag values as long as you provide the bootstrapped values as a map of flag keys and values. If you indicate that the SDK should bootstrap flags from local storage, this will not happen until the SDK initializes.
To learn more, read [`waitForInitialization`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDClient.html#waitForInitialization) and [How to defer initialization of the React SDK](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDClient.html#waitForInitialization).
 * `flags`: If you specify this property, the React Web SDK will only listen for changes to these flags. If you do not specify this property, the React Web SDK will request and listen to all flags. This property is optional.
Specify the `flags` property as a map of flag keys and values. The flag keys must be in their original form as known to LaunchDarkly, rather than in their camel-cased form. Note that the values you provide here are **not** used during flag evaluation.
To learn more, read [`ProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/interfaces/ProviderConfig.html).
## Hooks
The React Web SDK offers two custom hooks which you can use as an alternative to `withLDConsumer`: `useFlags` and `useLDClient`.
##### These functions require React 16.8.0 or later
Both `useFlags` and `useLDClient` use the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.
`useFlags` is a custom hook which returns all feature flags. It uses the `useContext` primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component at the root of your application to initialize the React Web SDK and populate the context with the client and your flags.
`useLDClient` is a custom hook which returns the underlying LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK client object. Like the `useFlags` custom hook, `useLDClient` also uses the `useContext` primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component to initialize the React Web SDK to use this custom hook.
For an example of how to use a custom hook, read [HooksDemo](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/main/examples/hoc/src/universal/hooksDemo.js).
## Flag keys in the React Web SDK
LaunchDarkly primarily identifies feature flags by a key which must contain only alphanumeric characters, dots (`.`), underscores (`_`), and dashes (`-`). These keys are used in the SDKs to identify flags, and in LaunchDarkly’s [REST API](/docs/home/infrastructure/api).
However, in JavaScript, accessing keys containing `.` and `-` requires the bracket operator. Instead of requiring this, the React Web SDK automatically changes all flag keys to camel case by default. A flag with key `dev-flag-test` is accessible as `flags.devFlagTest`.
Automatically changing flag keys to camel case poses some problems:
 * It is possible to induce a key collision if there are multiple LaunchDarkly flag keys which resolve to the same camel-case key. For example, `dev-flag-test` and `dev.flag.test` are unique keys in LaunchDarkly, but the React Web SDK changes them to the same camel-case key.
 * If a flag key contains three or more capital letters in a row, the React Web SDK automatically converts all letters between the first and last capital letter to lower case. For example, the SDK converts a flag with the key `devQAFlagTest` to `devQaFlagTest`. If you use `devQAFlagTest` with the `useFlags()` hook, the SDK will not find the flag.
 * LaunchDarkly’s [code references](/docs/home/flags/code-references) tool expects your source code to reference the exact key, not a camel-case equivalent. The tool does not detect keys that were automatically changed to camel-case. However, you can configure an alias to ensure that the code references tool detects the camel-case equivalents. To learn more, read [Find flag aliases](/docs/home/flags/code-references#find-flag-aliases).
 * Because the camel-case functionality is implemented in the React Web SDK instead of in the underlying JavaScript SDK, the underlying `client` object and functionality provided by the JavaScript SDK reflect flag keys in their original format. Only React-specific contexts such as your injected props use camel case.
To disable the SDK’s automatic camel-case feature, provide `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider` with the `reactOptions.useCamelCaseFlagKeys` property. The SDK supports this in versions 2.13.0 and later.
Here’s how to configure the automatic camel-case feature:
JavaScript
```
1
| export default withLDProvider({
---|--- 
2
| clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
3
| reactOptions: {
4
| useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
5
| }
6
| })(App);
```
With this configuration option in place, you can access your `dev-flag-test` flag using bracket notation, for example, `flag['dev-flag-test']`.
If you enable the automatic camel-case feature and you want to use LaunchDarkly’s code references tool, you can configure [alias](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/main/docs/ALIASES.md#configuring-aliases) support to find camel-cased flags. To do so, use the value `camelCase` for the alias settings.
## Example app
Run this [example](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/tree/main/examples/hoc) for a fully working single page app with React and react-router. You must enter your `clientSideId` in the [client root app file](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/main/examples/hoc/src/universal/app.js) and create a flag with key `dev-test-flag` in your **Flags** list before running the example.
## Importing types
In addition to its own bundled types, the React Web SDK uses types from `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`. If you use Typescript and you need to use `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` types, you can install the `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` package as a dev dependency. You can then import the types you want directly from `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`.
If you are using the React Web SDK within a React application that uses TypeScript, you may encounter some compiler errors or warnings initially. One solution is to wrap your component in a `withLDProvider` function, and then coerce your component to type `<ComponentType<{}>`. To learn how, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).
If you use eslint, the SDK requires that you add `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` as a dev dependency. Otherwise, eslint will report a `no-extraneous-dependencies` error.
## Events
Versions 2.27 and later of the React Web SDK send evaluation events when your app accesses a flag from the `flags` object obtained by using `useFlags` or `withLDConsumer`, and when you call a variation method on the `LDClient`.
In versions 2.26 and earlier of the React Web SDK, you must make variation calls directly to send evaluation events.
##### Experimentation events
Setting `reactOptions.sendEventsOnFlagRead: false` could prevent Experimentation events from recording correctly. Always confirm that this option is disabled when troubleshooting experiments.
To learn more about the `sendEventsOnlyForVariation` option, read the [JavaScript SDK API documentation](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDOptions.html#sendEventsOnlyForVariation). To learn more about the `sendEventsOnFlagRead` option, read the [React Web SDK API documentation](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/interfaces/LDReactOptions.html#sendEventsOnFlagRead).
##### Do Not Track and ad blocking software
The React Web SDK respects the [Do Not Track events](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) header. If an end user has Do Not Track enabled in their browser, the SDK does not send analytics events for flag evaluations or metrics to `events.launchdarkly.com`. To learn more, read [Browser privacy settings block analytic events to LaunchDarkly](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/articles/13689033183771-Browser-privacy-settings-block-analytic-events-to-LaunchDarkly). In addition, ad blocking software may block analytics events from being sent. This does not impact feature flag evaluations. To learn more about the events SDKs send to LaunchDarkly, read [Analytics events](/docs/sdk/concepts/events).
## Troubleshooting
This section describes common issues you might encounter when using the React Web SDK and how to resolve them.
### Network error
If your application logs show the error `LaunchDarklyFlagFetchError: network error`, there may be a problem with network connectivity between your SDK and LaunchDarkly.
For steps to resolve this issue, read the LaunchDarkly Knowledge Base article [Error “LaunchDarklyFlagFetchError: network error”](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/articles/12998125691419-Error-LaunchDarklyFlagFetchError-network-error).
### CORS errors in local development
If you see CORS errors in the browser while using the ldcli dev-server, check your SDK configuration. The React Web SDK must use your project key as the credential and all service endpoints must point to `http://localhost:8765`.
If you use a client-side ID instead of the project key, the SDK connects to LaunchDarkly rather than the dev-server. This prevents the SDK from retrieving local flag values and can produce CORS errors.
