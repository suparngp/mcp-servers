## Overview
This topic explains how you can receive approval notifications in Microsoft Teams. Approvals let you request review for changes you plan to make to a flag. You can view approval requests from within the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app. The LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app supports approval requests for feature flag changes only.
To use this feature, you must have installed and configured the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams app. To learn how, read [Setting up the Microsoft Teams app](/docs/integrations/microsoft-teams/setting-up).
To learn more about approvals, read [Approvals](/docs/home/releases/approvals).

Here’s how to view approval requests in the Microsoft Teams app:
