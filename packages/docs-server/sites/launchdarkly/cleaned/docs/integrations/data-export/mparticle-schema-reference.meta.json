  "description": "This topic explains the different event kinds for mParticle Data Export destinations. The JSON schemas for mParticle are formatted differently than LaunchDarkly’s. The `index`, `identify`, and `summary` event kinds are **not available** in mParticle Data Export destinations, and other events are exported with different labels."
