## Overview
This topic explains the schema of Data Export events.
Data Export exposes the following kinds of events:
 * `feature` events
 * `index` events
 * `identify` events
 * `click` events
 * `page view` events
 * `custom` events
 * `summary` events. To export `summary` events, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
 * `debug` events
LaunchDarkly no longer supports `alias` events for SDKs that support contexts. LaunchDarkly continues to support sending and receiving `alias` events for older SDK versions and for SDKs that do not yet support contexts. For a list of SDKs that still support `alias` events, read [Aliasing users](/docs/sdk/features/aliasing-users).
Some Data Export destinations have different event formatting schema. If you use mParticle or Segment as your event destination, we have specific documentation for their event schema:
 * [mParticle schema reference](/docs/integrations/data-export/mparticle-schema-reference)
 * [Segment schema reference](/docs/integrations/data-export/segment-schema-reference)
These events are described in more detail below.
## Event kinds
This table lists event kinds:
Description | Event kind 
---|--- 
feature | This event kind includes full-fidelity details of each individual feature flag evaluation. These events are present both for flags evaluated directly by a LaunchDarkly SDK, and for flags evaluated indirectly (for example, flags that are prerequisites of flags being evaluated directly). These events are only present if you explicitly enable detailed tracking for a feature flag, or if you are using an older SDK. 
index | This event kind contains the context attributes for a particular context, defined by a context key, when a feature flag evaluates the context. This event kind is not available for Segment or mParticle destinations. To export `index` events, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). 
identify | This event kind passes details about a context provided in an explicit `identify` call to the SDK. This event kind is not available for Segment or mParticle destinations. 
click | This event kind is generated by the LaunchDarkly SDK when an end user clicks on an HTML element matching a CSS selector configured on an experiment metric. 
page view | This event kind is generated by the LaunchDarkly SDK when an end user loads a page with URL matching a regular expression configured on an experiment metric. 
custom | This event kind is generated: 
 * when your application calls any of the SDK’s `track*` methods
 * automatically when the SDK is initialized, when an error occurs, and when other web vitals occur, if you are using an [observability SDK](/docs/sdk/observability)
summary | This event kind describes a roll-up of individual feature evaluations over an interval. These events are present both for flags evaluated directly by a LaunchDarkly SDK, and for flags evaluated indirectly (for example, flags that are prerequisites of flags being evaluated directly). To export `summary` events, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). 
debug | This event kind is similar to the `feature` event, except that it inlines the context value. This event kind is only sent if the `debugEventsUntilDate` attribute is set for a feature flag. 
##### mParticle and Segment schema differences
The `index` and `identify` event kinds are **not available** for Segment and mParticle destinations.
## SDK versioning for events
Newer SDKs generate the `summary` and `index` events described below. Older SDKs always send `feature` events regardless of whether detailed tracking is enabled for that flag.
Newer SDKs send `contextKeys` and `context` as objects inside `feature` and `custom` events. Older SDKs send `user` or `userKeys` objects instead.
###### Expand for additional information on event versions
SDKs generate events using a schema versioned in the following way:
 * Events sent from SDKs upgraded for contexts are version `4`.
 * Events sent from SDKs that only support users are version `3`.
 * Events sent from supported versions of the PHP SDK, through version 6.0, are version `2`. Events sent from the PHP SDK version 6.1 and later are version `4`.
**Each of these SDK event schemas are part of version 2 of the Data Export event schema.** The definitions and examples on this page show the Data Export event schema version. If you are inspecting the events sent directly by your SDK, for example as part of debugging a Data Export integration, you may notice the SDK event versions.
##### Enabling detailed analytics events
To receive `feature` events, in addition to `index`, `identify`, and `custom` events, check the **Send detailed events to data export destinations** checkbox on a flag’s [environment-specific settings](/docs/home/flags/flag-settings) page, or an environment’s **Edit** panel. By default, LaunchDarkly does not export `summary` events. To export `summary` events, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
## Event kind structures
LaunchDarkly sends each of these events as JSON files to your destinations.
All events have the following top level structure:
Example event
```
1
| {
---|--- 
2
| "project": "5744c96707c9900708000004",
3
| "environment": "578d1e02d2943862c52b9686",
4
| "event": {"id": "abc123xyz", ...},
5
| "version": 2,
6
| }
```
 * `project`: The ID of the LaunchDarkly project associated with the event.
 * `environment`: The ID of the LaunchDarkly environment associated with the event.
 * `version`: The Data Export event version.
 * `event`: The event itself. It is an object with a structure described below, depending on the `kind` of event.
 * `id`: Each event has a unique ID generated at export time. Due to Data Export’s [delivery guarantee model](/docs/integrations/data-export#streaming-data-export-delivery-guarantees) it is possible for an event ID to be delivered more than once, so we do not recommend relying exclusively on these IDs for de-duplication.
## Feature events
`Feature` events represent individual flag evaluations and are considered “full fidelity” events. Feature events are only sent by the SDK in one of these scenarios:
 * the `trackEvents` or `trackEventsFallthrough` attribute on the flag configuration is sent
 * the `trackEvents` attribute on a targeting rule is sent
 * the targeting rule or default rule when on has a rollout of kind `"experiment"` and the variation associated with the event is included in the tracked variations for that rollout
Here is an example `feature` event:
Feature event exampleVersion 1 feature event example
```
1
| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|--- 
2
| {
3
| "kind": "feature",
4
| "id": "abc123xyz",
5
| "creationDate": 1462220944000,
6
| "contextKeys": {
7
| "user": "context-key-123abc"
8
| },
9
| "context": {
10
| "key": "context-key-123abc",
11
| "kind": "user",
12
| "name": "Sandy"
13
| },
14
| "key": "flag-key",
15
| "value": ["evaluation", "result"],
16
| "default": null,
17
| "version": 1,
18
| "variation": 0,
19
| "prereqOf": "upstream-key",
20
| "reason": {
21
| "kind": "RULE_MATCH",
22
| "ruleIndex": 0,
23
| "ruleId": "id",
24
| "inExperiment": true,
25
| "bigSegmentsStatus": "HEALTHY"
26
| },
27
| "samplingRatio": 10
28
| }
```
Here is a list of `feature` event properties:
 * `kind`: The kind for a `feature` event is `feature`. An SDK only generates a `feature` event if the you set the `trackEvents` attribute of the flag to `true`. You can also control this with settings in the UI.
 * `creationDate`: When the SDK requested the feature flag, as UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.
 * `key`: The key of the feature flag requested.
 * `variation`: The variation of the flag requested. The SDK stores flag variation values in an array. This value corresponds to the index of the variation the array. Boolean flags show as `0` or `1` for `true` and `false`. For other flags, the array index starts at `0` for the different variations.
 * `variationName`: The evaluated variation’s name, if it exists. If the evaluated variation doesn’t have a name, this field doesn’t appear.
 * `value`: The value of the feature flag returned by feature flag evaluation.
 * `default`: The default value that the application passed in.
 * `version`: The version of the evaluated feature flag.
 * `reason`: (Optional) Included only if the flag being evaluated was in an experiment and the target was part of the experiment allocation, or if you called a [variation detail method](/docs/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).
 * Evaluations that were part of an experiment have the optional `inExperiment` attribute on the evaluation reason set to `true`. Evaluations that were not part of an experiment omit this attribute.
 * If you called a variation detail method, the `reason` property will be a JSON representation of the evaluation reason.
 * `prereqOf`: A feature flag key, if this flag evaluation was only performed in order to determine whether the prerequisite values were met for the indicated flag.
 * `contextKeys`: The keys of the `context` object used in a feature flag evaluation. SDKs periodically transmit details for the `context` object used in a feature flag evaluation as reported by the `feature` event with a separate `index` event.
 * `context`: The `context` object used in a feature flag evaluation.
 * `userKey`: The key of the `user` object used in a feature flag evaluation. SDKs periodically transmit details for the user object used in a feature flag evaluation as reported by the `feature` event with a separate `index` event. Not included if your SDK configuration is set to inline users. Not included if your SDK supports contexts.
 * `user`: The `user` object used in a feature flag evaluation. Only included if your SDK configuration is set to inline users. Not included if your SDK supports contexts.
## Index events
Enabling index event exports
By default, LaunchDarkly does not export `index` events. To export `index` events, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). To learn more, read [How to enable index events for Data Export](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/articles/20597402550043-How-to-enable-index-events-for-Data-Export).
Server-side SDKs send `index` events periodically to describe the attributes of contexts referenced by the `contextKey` in `feature` events.
An example `index` event is shown below:
Index event exampleVersion 1 index event example
```
1
| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|--- 
2
| {
3
| "kind": "index",
4
| "id": "abc123xyz",
5
| "creationDate": 1462220944000,
6
| "context": {
7
| "key": "context-key-123abc",
8
| "kind": "user",
9
| "name": "Sandy Smith",
10
| "jobFunction": "doctor",
11
| "moreComplex": {
12
| "city": "Springfield",
13
| "moreThanOne": [1, 2, 3]
14
| }
15
| }
16
| }
```
Here is a list of `index` event properties:
 * `kind`: The kind of an `index` event is `index`.
 * `creationDate`: The time this context was recorded at UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.
 * `context`: The same schema as `context` objects for feature flag evaluation.
 * `userKey`: The same schema as `userKey` for feature flag evaluation. Not included if your SDK configuration is set to inline users. Not included if your SDK supports contexts.
 * `user`: The same schema as `user` objects for feature flag evaluation. Only included if your SDK configuration is set to inline users. Not included if your SDK supports contexts.
Server-side SDKs determine when to send index events
Server-side SDKs have internal logic that determines whether it is necessary to send an `index` event. SDKs do not create `index` events for every flag evaluation. If the SDKs identify the same context multiple times in succession, the SDK does not send multiple `index` events. The SDK identifies contexts based on the contexts’ keys.
Client-side SDKs do not send `index` events. Instead, client-side SDKs send `identify` events when the SDK initializes, which include all of the context properties.
## Identify events
`identify` events are produced when the client application calls the `identify` SDK method. `identify` events have a similar structure to `index` events.
An example `identify` event is shown below:
Identify event exampleVersion 1 identify event example
```
1
| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| {
4
| "kind": "identify",
5
| "id": "abc123xyz",
6
| "creationDate": 1462220944000,
7
| "context": {
8
| "key": "context-key-123abc",
9
| "kind": "user",
10
| "name": "Sandy Smith",
11
| "jobFunction": "doctor",
12
| "moreComplex": {
13
| "city": "Springfield",
14
| "moreThanOne": [1, 2, 3]
15
| }
16
| }
17
| }
```
Here is a list of `identify` event properties:
 * `kind`: The kind of an `identify` event is `identify`.
 * `creationDate`: The time this context was recorded at UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.
 * `context`: The same schema as `context` objects for feature flag evaluation.
 * `userKey`: The same schema as `userKey` for feature flag evaluation. Not included if your SDK configuration is set to inline users. Not included if your SDK supports contexts.
 * `user`: The same schema as `user` objects for feature flag evaluation. Only included if your SDK configuration is set to inline users. Not included if your SDK supports contexts.
## Click events
JavaScript-based SDKs produce `click` events when an end user clicks on an HTML element matching a CSS selector configured on an experiment metric. To learn more, read [Clicked or tapped conversion metrics](/docs/home/metrics/click).
An example `click` event is shown below:
Click event exampleVersion 1 click event example
```
1
| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| {
4
| "kind": "click",
5
| "id": "abc123xyz",
6
| "key": "<internal id, not used>",
7
| "url": "https://example.com/",
8
| "creationDate": 16420388151234,
9
| "selector": "button.click-track",
10
| "contextKeys": {
11
| "user": "Sandy",
12
| "anonymousUser": "123213421231"
13
| }
14
| }
```
## Page view events
JavaScript-based SDKs produce `pageview` events when an end user loads a page with URL matching a regular expression configured on an experiment metric. To learn more, read [Page viewed conversion metrics](/docs/home/metrics/pageview).
An example `pageview` event is shown below:
Page view event exampleVersion 1 page view event example
```
1
| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| {
4
| "kind": "pageview",
5
| "id": "abc123xyz",
6
| "key": "<internal id, not used>",
7
| "url": "https://example.com/",
8
| "creationDate": 16420388151234,
9
| "contextKeys": {
10
| "user": "Sandy",
11
| "anonymousUser": "123213421231"
12
| }
13
| }
```
## Custom events
SDKs produce `custom` events:
 * when your application calls any of the SDK’s `track*` methods
 * automatically when the SDK is initialized, when an error occurs, and when other web vitals occur, if you are using an [observability SDK](/docs/sdk/observability)
![](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/launchdarkly/terminal.svg)
Try it in your SDK: [Sending custom events](/docs/sdk/features/events)
##### mParticle and Segment schema differences
The `data` event kind is **not available** for mParticle or Segment events.
An example `custom` event is shown below. The `metricValue` field will not appear if the event did not provide a metric value.
Custom event exampleVersion 1 custom event example
```

| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|---

| {
4
| "kind": "custom",
5
| "id": "abc123xyz",
6
| "key": "example-event-key",
7
| "creationDate": 16420388151234,
8
| "data": { "arbitrary": "customer-provided-data" },
9
| "metricValue": 5.3,
10
| "samplingRatio": 10,
11
| "contextKeys": {
12
| "user": "context-key-123abc"
13
| },
14
| "context": {
15
| "key": "context-key-123abc",
16
| "kind": "user",
17
| "name": "Sandy"
18
| }
19
| }
```
If the `custom` events are generated by your application when it calls an SDK’s `track` method, then the `data` field will include the information that you pass to the `track` call.
If the `custom` events are generated by LaunchDarkly, for example if you are using a LaunchDarkly [observability SDK](/docs/sdk/observability), then the `data` field will have a specific structure. For instance, in `custom` events that are automatically created by LaunchDarkly because of an error, the `data` field is a JSON object that always includes a `sessionId`.
## Summary events
Enabling summary event exports
By default, LaunchDarkly does not export `summary` events. To export `summary` events, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
SDKs send `summary` events periodically to describe a set of feature evaluations. Summary events include all feature evaluations, regardless of whether the `trackEvents` field was set for individual flags. They are sent when events are flushed, or during the configured flush interval. To learn more, read [Event buffering and sending](/docs/sdk/concepts/events#event-buffering-and-sending).
An example `summary` event is shown below:
Summary event exampleVersion 1 summary event example
```
1
| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| {
4
| "kind": "summary",
5
| "id": "abc123xyz",
6
| "startDate": 1517350765387,
7
| "endDate": 1517350825243,
8
| "features": {
9
| "flag-key-123abc": {
10
| "default": true,
11
| "counters": [
12
| {
13
| "value": true,
14
| "count": 10,
15
| "version": 3
16
| }
17
| ],
18
| "contextKinds": ["user", "device"]
19
| }
20
| }
21
| }
```
The `summary` event represents a set of feature flag evaluations occurring during an interval defined by `startDate` and `endDate`, sorted by feature flag.
Each feature flag includes the following details:
Field | Meaning 
---|--- 
`startDate` | The timestamp of the first feature flag evaluation included in this packet. This value is a UNIX epoch time in milliseconds. 
`endDate` | The timestamp of the last feature flag evaluation included in this packet. This value is a UNIX epoch time in milliseconds. 
`default` | The default value the SDK received for the feature, sampled at some point during the interval. 
`counters` | A set of counters as described below. 
`contextKind` (version 4 only) | The context kinds used to evaluate the flag. 
The `counters` field is an array of objects with the following contents:
Field | Meaning 
---|--- 
`version` | The version of the feature flag evaluated. 
`value` | The value the SDK returned for the flag evaluation. 
`variation` | A zero-based index into the list of variations. If LaunchDarkly does not provide this field, it means the SDK returned a fallback value. 
`count` | The number of times this value/version/variation combination was an evaluation result during the interval. 
`unknown` (optional) | If this is present and true, it indicates that no flag by this name was known to LaunchDarkly, and therefore the SDK returned the fallback value. 
## Debug events
The `debug` event is a variant of the `feature` event, with two differences. It has `kind` set to `debug` and it inlines the `context` value. The information can help you to troubleshoot feature flag evaluations more quickly.
SDKs send `debug` events only if the `debugEventsUntilDate` attribute is set for a feature flag and the attribute indicates a UNIX epoch timestamp in milliseconds that has not yet elapsed.
To set the `debugEventsUntilDate` attribute for a feature flag, navigate to the **Live events** page. Find a summary event for the flag you are interested in and click **Full fidelity details**.
`debug` events are not controlled by the `trackEvents` field.
Here is an example `debug` event:
Debug event
```
1
| // this example is from Data Export event schema version 2
---|--- 
2
| 
3
| {
4
| "kind": "debug",
5
| "id": "abc123xyz",
6
| "context": {
7
| "key": "context-key-123abc",
8
| "kind": "user",
9
| "name": "Sandy"
10
| },
11
| "creationDate": 1462220944000,
12
| "key": "flag-key-123abc",
13
| "value": false,
14
| "default": false,
15
| "version": 42,
16
| "prereqOf": "parent-flag-key-456def"
17
| }
```
Here is a list of the `debug` event properties:
 * `kind`: The kind of a `debug` event is `debug`.
 * `context`: The same schema as `context` objects for feature flag evaluation.
 * `creationDate`: When the SDK requested the feature flag, as UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.
 * `key`: The key of the feature flag requested.
 * `value`: The value of the feature flag returned by feature flag evaluation.
 * `default`: Optional. This will be `true` if the feature flag evaluation failed and the SDK served the fallback value instead. This field will be `false` or omitted if the SDK did not serve the fallback value.
