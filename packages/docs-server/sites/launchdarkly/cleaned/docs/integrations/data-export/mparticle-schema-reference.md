## Overview
This topic explains the different event kinds for mParticle Data Export destinations. The JSON schemas for mParticle are formatted differently than LaunchDarkly’s. The `index`, `identify`, and `summary` event kinds are **not available** in mParticle Data Export destinations, and other events are exported with different labels.
To learn more about the mParticle destination, read [mParticle’s documentation](https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/launchdarkly).
There are four different event kinds mParticle uses. They are:
 * [`Feature` events](/docs/integrations/data-export/mparticle-schema-reference#feature-events): This event appears when a feature flag is evaluated.
 * [`Click` events](/docs/integrations/data-export/mparticle-schema-reference#click-events): This event appears when an end user clicks on a CSS selector for which they have configured a metric in an experiment.
 * [`Page view` events](/docs/integrations/data-export/mparticle-schema-reference#page-view-events): This event appears when an end user loads a page associated with an experiment metrics.
 * [`Custom` events](/docs/integrations/data-export/mparticle-schema-reference#custom-events): The LaunchDarkly SDK sends a `custom` event.
## Feature events
This table lists `feature` events:
Description | Event details 
---|--- 
event_type: custom_event 
custom_event_type “other” 
event_name: Feature | Describes a feature flag evaluation which occurred in a LaunchDarkly SDK event_type: “custom” for this event. 
### Custom attributes
This table lists custom attributes:
Description | Attribute event details 
---|--- 
project | ID of the LaunchDarkly project associated with the event. 
environment | The LaunchDarkly environment ID, also called the client-side ID, associated with the event. 
version | The version of event schema. 
flag_version | The version number of the flag when it was evaluated. 
value | The value of the feature flag returned by feature flag evaluation. 
key | The key of the flag requested. 
default | Whether the flag evaluation was a result of the default value being used. Is set to true if feature flag evaluation failed, if omitted assumed to be false. 
reason_kind | If a `feature` event was generated through a “variation detail” method, the event will have a reason property with the JSON representation of the evaluation reason. 
prerequisite_of | Set to another flag’s key if this flag evaluation was only performed in order to determine whether the prerequisite values were met for the indicated flag. 
variation_name | The evaluated variation’s name, if it exists. If the evaluated variation doesn’t have a name, this field doesn’t appear. 
## Click events

### Custom attributes
This table lists custom attributes:
Description | Attribute event details 
---|--- 
project | ID of the LaunchDarkly project associated with the event. 
environment | The LaunchDarkly environment ID, also called the client-side ID, associated with the event. 
version | The version of event schema. 
key | The key of the feature flag requested.

Description | Attribute event details 
---|--- 
project | ID of the LaunchDarkly project associated with the event. 
environment | The LaunchDarkly environment ID, also called the client-side ID, associated with the event. 
version | The version of event schema. 
key | The key of the feature flag requested. 
url | The URL of the page the end user was on when the page view occurred. 
## Custom events
