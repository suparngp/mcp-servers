## Overview
This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams integration.
You can use the LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams integration to receive notifications when LaunchDarkly resources change. For example, you can receive alerts when a feature flag changes or when a new approval is requested for changes to a feature flag. These notifications appear in your Teams space. You can also unfurl feature flag and segment links in conversations.
The LaunchDarkly Microsoft Teams integration lets you:
