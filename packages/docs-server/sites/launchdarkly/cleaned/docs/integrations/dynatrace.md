## Overview
This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integrations available, including events and triggers.
[Dynatrace](https://dynatrace.com/) is an infrastructure monitoring platform that offers [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) and automated problem remediation.
## Events
##### The Dynatrace events integration is available to customers on select plans
The Dynatrace events integration is only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
The LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integration makes it easier to diagnose problems by sending flag change events to Dynatrace. To learn how, read [Using the Dynatrace events integration](/docs/integrations/dynatrace/events).
## Triggers
LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Dynatrace. You can use flag triggers to automate flag changes. For example, you can create an alert in Dynatrace that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag’s targeting on or off when Dynatrace triggers a predefined or custom event. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Dynatrace](/docs/integrations/dynatrace/triggers).
