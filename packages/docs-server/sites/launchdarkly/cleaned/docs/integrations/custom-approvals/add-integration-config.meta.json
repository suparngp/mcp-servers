  "description": "This topic describes how to add a custom approvals integration within LaunchDarkly. This is the second step required when building a [custom approvals integration](/docs/integrations/custom-approvals). Only customers with complex workflow management or approval systems in third-party applications that LaunchDarkly does not integrate with directly are likely to need a custom approvals integration."
