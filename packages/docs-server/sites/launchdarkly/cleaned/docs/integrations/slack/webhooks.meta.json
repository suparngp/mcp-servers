  "description": "This topic explains how to use the Slack webhook integration to set up [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to receive any activities in LaunchDarkly. When you change something in LaunchDarkly, for example, when you update a feature flag, update a segment, or invite a new account member, LaunchDarkly sends an incoming webhook to Slack."
