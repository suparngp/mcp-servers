##### The Netlify integration is available to customers on select plans
The Netlify integration is only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
## Overview
The Netlify integration enables flag evaluation within Netlify Functions and Netlify Edge Functions. The integration writes the latest flag data from a configured LaunchDarkly environment directly to an edge-cached Netlify Blob in your account. It also sends any change to a flag or segment configuration in your selected environment to your Netlify Blob, ensuring your store is always up to date.
Netlify manages this integration. To learn how to use it, read Netlify’s [LaunchDarkly Integration](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/launchdarkly-integration/).
