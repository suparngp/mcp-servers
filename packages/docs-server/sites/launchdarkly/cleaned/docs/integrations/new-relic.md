## Overview
This topic explains the LaunchDarkly New Relic One integrations available, including events and triggers.
[New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com/) is an [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) tool that allows customers to monitor the operational health of their application and infrastructure.

LaunchDarkly integrates with New Relic. LaunchDarkly sends feature flag change events to New Relic as deployment events. To learn how to set up this integration, read [Using the New Relic events integration](/docs/integrations/new-relic/events).
## Triggers
##### Flag triggers are available to customers on select plans
Flag triggers are only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with New Relic. For example, you can create an policy in New Relic that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag’s targeting on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with New Relic One](/docs/integrations/new-relic/triggers).
