## Overview
This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Datadog integrations available, including events, the dashboard widget, triggers, and Real User Monitoring (RUM).
[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a infrastructure & application monitoring service that offers [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) and analytics.
## Events
##### The Datadog events integration is available to customers on select plans
The Datadog events integration is only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
The Datadog events integration lets you set up [Datadog Events](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=bash#events) to receive activity from LaunchDarkly. When something changes, such as a feature flag updates or a new account member is added, LaunchDarkly can send an event to Datadog. To learn how, read [Using the Datadog events integration](/docs/integrations/datadog/events).
## Dashboard widget
##### This integration is deprecated
The Datadog UI extensions have been deprecated by Datadog as of March 31, 2025. You can recreate the functionality using the Datadog App Builder. To learn how, read [Using the Datadog dashboard widget](/docs/integrations/datadog/dashboard-widget).
The Datadog dashboard widget lets you pin feature flags to your Datadog dashboards to monitor and toggle flags from within Datadog. To learn how to set up the widget, read [Using the Datadog dashboard widget](/docs/integrations/datadog/dashboard-widget).
## Triggers
##### Flag triggers are available to customers on select plans
Flag triggers are only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Datadog. You can use flag triggers to automate flag changes. For example, you can create an alert in Datadog that toggles a flag’s targeting on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Datadog](/docs/integrations/datadog/triggers).
## Datadog RUM
##### The Datadog RUM integration is available to customers on select plans
The Datadog RUM integration is only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
Datadog’s LaunchDarkly RUM integration allows you to send feature flag evaluation data from the LaunchDarkly [JavaScript SDK](/docs/sdk/client-side/javascript) to Datadog as event properties. To learn how, read [Datadog RUM](/docs/integrations/datadog/rum).
