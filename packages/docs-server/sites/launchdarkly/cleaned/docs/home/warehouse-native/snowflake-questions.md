## Overview
This topic provides answers to common questions about working with Snowflake native Experimentation.
Before you begin setting up the Snowflake integration, read the [Snowflake data requirements](/docs/home/warehouse-native/snowflake-requirements). Then, follow the setup instructions in [Setting up the Snowflake integration](/docs/home/warehouse-native/snowflake-configure).
If you have further questions about the integration, read the sections below.
## Roles and permissions
To set up Snowflake Data Export, you must have the following permissions in Snowflake:
 * `SYSADMIN`
 * `SECURITYADMIN`
To set up the [LaunchDarkly Warehouse Native Experimentation app](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZQFHRJ4/launchdarkly-warehouse-native-experimentation) in Snowflake, you must have the following permissions in Snowflake:
 * `ACCOUNTADMIN`
## IP addresses
You must add to your allow list the following outbound IP addresses:
 * `52.21.152.96/32`
 * `52.200.35.24/32`
 * `52.200.50.23/32`
 * `54.144.218.89/32`
 * `54.221.221.197/32`
 * `34.236.6.43/32`
For a full list of LaunchDarkly’s public IP addresses, read [Public IP list](/docs/home/infrastructure/ip-list).
## Snowflake resources and warehouses
You must name your Snowflake resources, including databases, schemas, and roles, according to [LaunchDarkly’s naming conventions](/docs/home/warehouse-native/snowflake-configure#step-2-in-snowflake-create-the-required-resources). The integration does not support flexible naming conventions.
You can use any of your existing Snowflake warehouses to install, initialize, and run the LaunchDarkly Warehouse Native Experimentation app in Snowflake. We suggest that you choose a small warehouse that you use for general needs so that it consumes minimal resources.
## Confirm your setup
If you have configured your setup correctly, you will observe your Snowflake dynamic tables being populated with data under the `LD_EXPERIMENTATION` database and `RESULTS_<project_env_key>` schema within the next few hours.
## Data transfer frequency
Snowflake Data Export runs an hourly job, on the hour, that publishes raw LaunchDarkly data in your Snowflake account. You can expect the new data to be available in your Snowflake account within 10-15 minutes after the hour.
## Updates to existing integrations
After your integration is set up, you cannot make further edits to it, and you cannot create a second integration using the same project/environment key. If you need to update any fields as part of the integration, you must delete the existing integration and start a new one.
### Delete existing integrations
Before you delete an existing integration, [stop any running warehouse native experiments](/docs/home/experimentation/start-stop-exp#stop-experiment-iterations) that are using data from the integration.
When you delete an existing integration the service disconnects from your Snowflake account. However, LaunchDarkly does not delete any stored event data. The LaunchDarkly user interface (UI) will still display related event data in places like the [event explorer](/docs/home/metrics/view-incoming-events), the event selection dropdown when [creating a metric](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics), and other areas where metric events are visible.
### Add new integrations
If you want to set up additional integrations for additional LaunchDarkly projects and environments, follow the same setup instructions for the additional integrations, including:
 * [Creating a metric events source](/docs/home/warehouse-native/snowflake-requirements) corresponding to the new LaunchDarkly project and environment
 * [Setting up Snowflake Data Export](/docs/integrations/data-export/snowflake) for the new LaunchDarkly project and environment
 * [Configuring Snowflake native Experimentation](/docs/home/warehouse-native/snowflake-configure) for the new LaunchDarkly project and environment
