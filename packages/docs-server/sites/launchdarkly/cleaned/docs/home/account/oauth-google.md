## Overview
This topic explains how to configure Google OAuth for LaunchDarkly.
##### Google OAuth is different from Google Apps SSO
This topic explains how to use Google OAuth. To learn how to configure single sign-on (SSO) for Google Apps instead, read [Google Apps](/docs/home/account/google).
If a member signs in to LaunchDarkly using Google OAuth, they cannot also sign in to the same account using Google Apps SSO. Similarly, if you invite a member to join a LaunchDarkly account using Google Apps SSO, they cannot also sign in using Google OAuth.
LaunchDarkly OAuth also does not support multiple accounts with the same email address. You will not be able to use Google OAuth to sign if you belong to multiple accounts with the same email address.
To sign in using Google OAuth, account members can use their Google account matching their LaunchDarkly login with the **Continue with Google** button on the LaunchDarkly sign in page:
![The "Continue with Google" button on the LaunchDarkly sign in page.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/9a18980e0b3a75b28d0f0f6221c1ded9b874172a15e976748b847b9b3dffef83/assets/images/auto/account-sign-in-google.auto.png)
The "Continue with Google" button on the LaunchDarkly sign in page.
If your organization uses Gmail and you have enabled domain matching, account members can also sign into LaunchDarkly using Google OAuth. To learn how to enable domain matching, read [Enable domain matching](/docs/home/account/org-settings#enable-domain-matching).
After they create their account, LaunchDarkly will add them to the correct LaunchDarkly organization using domain matching. If your organization does not have domain matching enabled, completing the sign up form will create a new account with a 14-day trial.
