## Overview
This topic explains how to view and copy environment keys and SDK credentials.
## Environment keys
You can view and copy an environment key from the Environments list:
![The Environments list with the overflow menu open.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/2be8ccac411c23c6dc87ba460ff57e14520e8bc6be5c092a17d628eff12c8411/assets/images/auto/environment-edit-environment.auto.png)
The Environments list with the overflow menu open.
You may need the environment key when configuring certain integrations.
## SDK credentials
You can view, copy, or reset certain SDK credentials for an environment from the Environments list. SDK credentials include the SDK key, mobile key, and client-side ID.
You need one of these credentials when you set up your SDK. Which credential you need depends on which SDK you use:
 * Use SDK keys for server-side and AI SDKs. SDK keys should be kept secret. If an SDK key is exposed, you can reset it. SDK keys always start with the prefix `sdk-`.
 * Use mobile keys for some client-side SDKs. Mobile keys do not need to be kept secret. However, if you wish to reset a mobile key, you can. Mobile keys always start with the prefix `mob-`.
 * Use client-side IDs for JavaScript-based client-side SDKs and for edge SDKs. The client-side ID does not need to be kept secret and cannot be reset. Client-side IDs are alphanumeric, and do not contain dashes.
##### Using ldcli dev-server with client-side SDKs
When you connect a client-side SDK to the ldcli dev-server for local testing, use your project key as the SDK credential and set all service endpoints to `http://localhost:8765`.
Do not use an SDK key, mobile key, or client-side ID with the dev-server. If you use a client-side ID, the SDK connects to LaunchDarkly instead of the dev-server, which can result in CORS errors.
To learn more about different SDK key types, read [About the different types of SDKs](/docs/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#about-the-different-types-of-sdks) and [Keys](/docs/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).
##### Looking for API access tokens?
To learn how to create and manage API access tokens, read [API access tokens](/docs/home/account/api).
### View SDK credentials
To view an environment’s key, its SDK key, its mobile key, and its client-side ID:
 1. Click the project dropdown. The project menu appears:
![The project menu.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/e7170a6ea679fd8c8210aa3660093eb18394effdc9571d713b907cbce33e24c0/assets/images/auto/project-menu-dropdown.auto.png)
The project menu.
 2. Select **Project settings**.
 3. Select **Environments**. The **Environments** list appears.
 4. Click the **overflow menu** for the environment.
![The Environments list with the overflow menu open.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/2be8ccac411c23c6dc87ba460ff57e14520e8bc6be5c092a17d628eff12c8411/assets/images/auto/environment-edit-environment.auto.png)
The Environments list with the overflow menu open.
 5. Click **Show SDK keys**. An “SDK Keys for [environment name]” dialog appears.
 6. The SDK credentials are hidden by default. To reveal a credential, click the **eye** icon.
### Copy SDK credentials
To copy an SDK key, mobile key, or client-side ID:
 1. Click the project dropdown. The project menu appears.
 2. Select **Project settings**.
 3. Select **Environments**. The **Environments** list appears.
 4. Click the **overflow menu** for the environment.
 5. Click **SDK key** , **Mobile key** , or **Client-side key** to copy the key.
### Reset SDK credentials
You can reset the SDK key and mobile key if needed. To learn how, read [Reset SDK credentials](/docs/home/account/environment/keys#reset-sdk-credentials).
