## Overview
This section explains what roles are and how to manage them.
Roles give you precise access control to everything in LaunchDarkly, including feature flags, projects, environments, metrics, and teams. Use them to enforce access policies that meet your exact needs.
Each account member must have at least one role, which is a set of permissions assigned to an account member when they are invited to LaunchDarkly. You can assign account members additional roles to give them the exact set of permissions they need.
An account member’s initial role is set when they’re invited to LaunchDarkly.
## Managing roles
Implementing roles is a four-step process.
To implement a role:
 1. Understand how a role’s resources, scope, and actions determine what access the role provides. To learn more, read [Member role concepts](/docs/home/account/roles/role-concepts).
 2. Create a role, or find a LaunchDarkly-provided role that meets your needs. Topics in this section describe how:
 * [Creating roles and policies](/docs/home/account/roles/role-create)
 * [Organization roles](/docs/home/account/roles/organization-roles)
 * [Project roles](/docs/home/account/roles/project-roles)
 * [Example roles and policies](/docs/home/account/roles/example-roles)
 3. Create or update the policy for that role. Topics in this section describe how:
 * [Editing roles](/docs/home/account/roles/role-edit)
 4. Assign the role to an account member or team. To learn how, read [Managing roles assignments](/docs/home/account/roles/manage-role-assignments).
