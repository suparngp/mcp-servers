## Overview
This topic explains how to enable a custom announcement banner that appears in LaunchDarkly for everyone in your organization.
You can use the banner to display organization-wide information, such as upcoming holidays, code freeze periods, or reminders on best practices. You can have one banner visible at a time.
The banner only displays text. It does not enable or prohibit any other actions in LaunchDarkly. For example, a banner announcing a release freeze does not prevent anyone from toggling flags or updating targeting rules.
## Add an announcement banner
To add an announcement banner:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **General**.
 3. Find the “Announcement banner” section.
 4. Enter the **Header** for your announcement.
 5. Enter the **Description** for your announcement.
 * The description supports a limited subset of Markdown formatting, including bold, italics, links, incline code, and lists.
 1. Select the **Style** for your announcement.
 2. Verify that the preview of the banner displays as you intend.
 3. Set the **Active period**.
##### Announcement banners use UTC
The **Active period** for the announcement banner is set in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Make sure to set the period appropriately for your organization.
 1. Click **Save changes**.
 2. The “Schedule announcement banner” dialog appears. In the dialog, review the scheduled dates for the banner.
 3. Click **Confirm**.
The announcement banner appears at the top of all pages in the LaunchDarkly user interface, except the settings pages, during the **Active period** that you specify.
To edit an announcement banner, follow the procedure above for adding a banner, and update any existing content. The updated banner appears during the **Active period** that you specify.
## Remove an announcement banner
To remove an announcement banner that is currently displayed:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **General**.
 3. Find the “Announcement banner” section.
 4. Click **Turn off banner**.
 5. The “Turn off banner” dialog appears. Click **Confirm**.
