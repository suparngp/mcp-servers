## Overview
This category contains documentation topics about how to set up and manage teams within your LaunchDarkly organization. A team is a group of members of your LaunchDarkly account.
In these topics, you can learn how to create teams in LaunchDarkly, add and remove members of your organization to teams, and use roles to give teams specific permissions and access to different parts of LaunchDarkly.
You can also request reviews from entire teams when submitting a flag, AI Config, or segment change request. To learn more, read [Approvals](/docs/home/releases/approvals).
To learn more about best practices for how to start using teams, read [Building teams in LaunchDarkly](/docs/guides/teams-roles/teams).
You can also sync groups from your IdP to teams within your account. To learn more, read about [team sync with SCIM](/docs/home/account/scim#team-sync-with-scim).

## Teams in LaunchDarkly
Teams are groups of your organization’s members. A LaunchDarkly account administrator can give specific permissions to teams using roles. These roles let team members perform actions on different resources, such as projects or flags. To learn more, read [Roles](/docs/home/account/roles).
Large organizations often need to set up fine-grained access rules and give those permissions to specific groups of people. Assigning permissions to groups of people in an organization can help make consistent security or general workflow processes. In LaunchDarkly, teams are the mechanism for enterprise organizations to do that efficiently.
A team is made up of the following collections of data:
 * A list of the **members** of the larger organization who are on that team.
 * A list of the **roles** that the team has, including any [parameterized resources](/docs/home/account/roles/role-scope) that the roles provide access to.
With teams you can:
 * Give new members in your organization a set of roles by adding them to an existing team.
 * Control resource access at the group level. For example, you can create a role that allows access to a specific project. You can name the project explicitly in the role definition, or you can leave the project unspecified in the role definition, and specify it when you add the role to a team’s access. The latter option means you can reuse the same role across multiple teams that work on different projects.
 * Map permissions in LaunchDarkly to your organizational structure. For example, you can give mobile flag permissions to the mobile team and desktop flag permissions to the desktop team, or give all organization members access to the staging environment, but only people on a particular team permissions to control flags on production.
