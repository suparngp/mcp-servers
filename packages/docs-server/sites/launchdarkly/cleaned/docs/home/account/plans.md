## Overview
This topic explains LaunchDarkly plans you can subscribe to and summarizes the features available on each. LaunchDarkly offers three tiers to choose from to fit your organization’s size and needs.
## Plan features
LaunchDarkly offers Developer, Foundation, Enterprise, and Guardian plans.
 * **Developer** plans help you get started with feature flags for passion projects.
 * **Foundation** plans include scalable feature management and Experimentation for growing teams.
 * **Enterprise** plans support advanced software delivery practices at Enterprise scale.
 * **Guardian** plans provide additional features to monitor and guard your releases at scale.
You can subscribe as a developer for free with limited usage of [service connections](/docs/home/account/metrics#service-connections), [MAU](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing#monthly-active-users-mau), and [Experimentation keys](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing#experimentation-keys). If you subscribe to a Foundation, Enterprise, or Guardian plan, monthly entitlements are included for each of these.
You can add [Data Export events](/docs/integrations/data-export) to Foundation, Enterprise, and Guardian plans as an add-on.
You can upgrade your organization’s subscription at any time. For more information about pricing and feature support, read [Pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). For assistance with right-sizing your account, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or read [How to right size when you are over LaunchDarkly system resource count limits](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/articles/12319971362075-How-to-right-size-when-you-are-over-LaunchDarkly-system-resource-count-limits).
## Guarded rollout availability
All LaunchDarkly accounts include a limited number of guarded rollouts to help you evaluate the feature in real-world scenarios. You can use these guarded rollouts on any environment and for any feature flag.
After you use the included number of guarded rollouts, you must upgrade to a Guardian plan to create new ones.
To learn more, read [Guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts).
## Free trials
When you sign up for a free trial with LaunchDarkly, your trial includes access to all of LaunchDarkly’s Guardian features.
When your trial ends, you have the option of continuing with a Guardian plan, or moving to a Developer, Foundation, or Enterprise plan:
 * If you continue with a Guardian plan, you will retain access to all Guardian features and any Guardian configuration you completed as part of your trial, including setting up [Guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts).
 * If you move to an Enterprise plan, you will retain access to all Enterprise features and any Enterprise configuration you completed as part of your trial, such as setting up [teams](/docs/home/account/teams) or [roles](/docs/home/account/roles). LaunchDarkly retains any account data related to Guardian features, but you cannot interact with it.
 * Any guarded rollout already configured on a flag will be available to start, and any guarded rollouts still in progress will complete. You will not be able to create new guarded rollouts on new flags.
 * If you move to a Developer or Foundation plan, LaunchDarkly retains any account data related to Enterprise and Guardian features, but you cannot interact with it.
 * Any guarded rollout already configured on a flag will be available to start, and any guarded rollouts still in progress will complete. You will not be able to create new guarded rollouts on new flags.
 * Any LaunchDarkly members that you assigned a custom or preset role will revert to the base role they had before you assigned the custom or preset role, such as the Reader base role.
 * The [Relay Proxy in offline mode](/docs/sdk/relay-proxy/offline) will still function, but you will not be able to download new flag rules.
You can also [delete your trial account](/docs/home/account/multiple-accounts#delete-trial-accounts), which permanently removes your account data.
