##### PingIdentity is not officially supported
We provide guidance for setting up SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) with PingIdentity, but PingIdentity is not an officially supported identity provider (IdP). We cannot provide additional support or configuration guidance for this configuration.
## Overview
This topic explains how to set up SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) with PingIdentity.
Setting up SSO with PingIdentity requires the following steps:
 1. Retrieving your Entity ID and ACS URL from LaunchDarkly
 2. Adding the LaunchDarkly application in PingIdentity
 3. Updating LaunchDarkly with URL and exchange certificate details
You can also set up member roles using the following steps:
 1. Defining user attributes in PingIdentity
 2. Mapping user attributes to LaunchDarkly
 3. Creating a PingIdentity group for LaunchDarkly access
 4. Assigning the group to the LaunchDarkly app
## Prerequisites
To give your organization access to LaunchDarkly through PingIdentity, you need the following components:
 * A LaunchDarkly Admin organization role, or an Admin or Owner base role, or another role with [permissions to update account SSO settings](/docs/home/account/roles/role-actions#account-actions)
 * PingIdentity Admin permissions
## Retrieve your Entity ID and ACS URL from LaunchDarkly
