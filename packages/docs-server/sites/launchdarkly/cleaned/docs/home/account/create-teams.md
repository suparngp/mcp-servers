## Overview
This topic explains how to create a new team in LaunchDarkly and the order in which to create teams and roles.
## Create a team
##### Creating teams is an Admin-only feature
Any LaunchDarkly member can access the **Teams** list to view team data. To create teams, you must have a LaunchDarkly Admin or Architect organization role, or an Admin or Owner base role, or another role that allows the `createTeam` action. To learn more, read [About member roles](/docs/home/account/members#about-member-roles) and [Team actions](/docs/home/account/roles/role-actions#team-actions).
Use the **Teams** page to create new teams or to edit existing teams, add and remove members to and from teams, and control what permissions the team has using roles.
To create a new team:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Teams**.
 3. Click **New team**. The “Create team” dialog appears.
 4. Give the team a human-readable **Name**.
 5. (Optional) Modify the team’s **Key** if you follow naming practices that require it.
 6. (Optional) Update the **Maintainer** for this team.
 7. (Optional) Enter a **Description**.
 8. Click **Create team**.
When you first create a team, it has no members and provides no access to any LaunchDarkly resources. To learn how to add members, read [Managing teams](/docs/home/account/manage-teams). To learn how to add access, read [Assigning roles to teams](/docs/home/account/roles/manage-role-team).
##### Team limits
By default, LaunchDarkly allows you to create 100 teams per account. You can create more upon request. To learn more, read [How to right size when you are over LaunchDarkly system resource count limits](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/articles/12319971362075-How-to-right-size-when-you-are-over-LaunchDarkly-system-resource-count-limits).
