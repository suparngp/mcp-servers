## Overview
This topic explains how to configure Google Apps to support single sign-on (SSO) in LaunchDarkly.
##### Google OAuth is different from Google Apps SSO
The procedures in this topic explain how to configure SSO for Google Apps. To learn how to configure Google OAuth instead, read [Google OAuth](/docs/home/account/oauth-google).
If a member signs in to LaunchDarkly using Google OAuth, they cannot also sign in to the same account using Google Apps SSO. Similarly, if you invite a member to join a LaunchDarkly account using Google Apps SSO, they cannot also sign in using Google OAuth.
## Prerequisites
To configure SSO for LaunchDarkly using Google Apps, you must complete the following prerequisite:
 * Configure SAML for authentication. For more information, read the [Google knowledge base](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519).
Use the table below to configure Google fields for LaunchDarkly:
Google field | LaunchDarkly setting 
---|--- 
ACS URL | Use LaunchDarkly’s Assertion Consumer Service URL value. 
Entity ID | Use LaunchDarkly’s Entity ID value. 
Start URL | Use LaunchDarkly’s Start URL value. 
Signed Response | Check this box. 
Name ID | Select “Basic Information” and “Primary Email” 
Name ID Format | Select “EMAIL” 
Attribute Mapping | Enter `role` as the `application attribute`, and select the [custom user attribute](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6208725?hl=en) that corresponds to the desired role. 
## Configure SSO for LaunchDarkly with Google Apps
Before you create the LaunchDarkly app in Google Apps, you must create the LaunchDarkly specific fields for roles and custom roles.
To configure these fields:
 1. Log into Google Apps.
 2. Navigate to your user directory by clicking **Directory** and then **Users**.
 3. Click the **Manage user attributes** icon. A popup screen appears:
![The "Manage user attributes" icon.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/ae718738d98f745d51c5f46ee81b28cbf902b3d9d45fb780eab8851ce0756318/assets/images/__third_party/google-manage-user-attributes.png)
The "Manage user attributes" icon.
 1. Select **Add Custom Category**.
 2. Name the custom category whatever you like. The example below uses **LaunchDarkly Attributes**.
 3. Add `role` and `customRole` fields:
![The "LaunchDarkly Attributes" screen.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/aeec0319186dfb6eafcdb84a96b644be933545b8c7af7e74f85e19bf7ba479ca/assets/images/__third_party/google-ld-attributes.png)
The "LaunchDarkly Attributes" screen.
##### Allow multiple values for custom roles
Set the **Multiple values** field for `customRole` to “Yes.” Some account members may have more than one custom role, which requires multiple values.
## Add LaunchDarkly as a custom SAML application
Next, you must add LaunchDarkly to your Google Apps apps.
To add LaunchDarkly:
 1. Log into Google Apps.
 2. Navigate to **Apps** , then **SAML Apps**.
 3. Click the plus button to **Add** an app.
 4. Select **Setup my own Custom App** to configure LaunchDarkly. The setup workflow initiates.
 5. In step 2 of the workflow, copy the information from the setup workflow. You’ll need to add this into LaunchDarkly’s **Security** tab under **Edit SAML Configuration** :
![The Google IdP information window.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/4fba88da32bd345f9985e68f00dc13f90d0720c9538233788aecf964df9b247b/assets/images/__third_party/google-idp-info.png)
The Google IdP information window.
 1. In step 3, enter the name of the app.
 2. In step 4 of the workflow, provide the **Assertion consumer service URL** , **entity ID** , and **start URL** for your LaunchDarkly account:
![LaunchDarkly's service provider details.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/fcd31cbf3f756c28e9a807142b42ff66ec8d0460c82b986624f047a4e11715ca/assets/images/__third_party/google-ld-service-provider-details.png)
LaunchDarkly's service provider details.
To find them, click **Edit your SAML configuration** on the LaunchDarkly **Security** tab:
![LaunchDarkly's SAML Configuration panel.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/19e44f01015e3aac5e72f5610db6342a723b9163ba33eb38d69b88720146fa6d/assets/images/auto/settings-security-saml-config.auto.png)
LaunchDarkly's SAML Configuration panel.
 1. In step 5, map the LaunchDarkly attributes `firstName` and `lastName` to Google’s “Basic Information” fields “First Name” and “Last Name.” Map the LaunchDarkly attributes `role` and `customRole` to Google’s “LaunchDarkly Attributes” fields “Role” and “Custom Roles.” These mappings are shown below:
![The Attribute Mappings screen.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/023410dc5feb0658f8c6b0ecb1949a8ec9064a848da66cf968a7774c1c118e2e/assets/images/__third_party/google-attribute-mapping.png)
The Attribute Mappings screen.
##### Names are case sensitive
In the screenshot above, the names in the left-hand columns map to those present in LaunchDarkly. You must name them exactly as shown or configuration will fail.
You’ve successfully connected LaunchDarkly to Google Apps.
## Assign roles and custom roles with Google Apps
Now that the application is configured, you can assign roles.
To assign roles:
 1. Log into Google Apps.
 2. Navigate to **Directory** , then **Users**.
 3. Click on the Google Apps user that you want to assign roles to and choose **Account** to bring up the user’s account settings.
 4. Click **Edit** beneath “Manage user attributes” to add the user’s roles to the corresponding attribute fields:
![The "Update User" screen.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/b3998640bf9a5c678821785a9a9b92a7817046f65f273f82a49ffd4b5a1a5f04/assets/images/__third_party/google-update-user.png)
The "Update User" screen.
 1. Click **Update User.**
The next time this user logs into LaunchDarkly through Google Apps, their roles will update. If this is a brand new LaunchDarkly account member, an account will be created automatically with the roles you specified.
##### Removing existing roles
SAML ignores empty **Roles** and **customRole** fields. To clear all existing roles, enter an empty string "" into the field.
