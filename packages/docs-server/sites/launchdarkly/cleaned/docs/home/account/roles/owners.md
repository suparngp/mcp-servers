## Overview
This topic explains how to change which account member has the Owner role in your LaunchDarkly account, as well as what the Owner role entails.
## About the Owner role
In LaunchDarkly, the Owner base role is a unique role that only one account member can have. Owners have absolute power over your entire LaunchDarkly account, including the ability to add or remove the Admin base role from other account members, or to remove the Owner base role from themselves and assign it to someone else.
Every LaunchDarkly account must have one member with the Owner base role. By default, the person who creates your LaunchDarkly account is given the Owner base role. The LaunchDarkly Billing Admin organization role, a [preset role](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#preset-roles) introduced in May 2025, also has the ability to change the account Owner.
To learn more about assigning member roles, read [Managing roles assignments](/docs/home/account/roles/manage-role-assignments).
## Change account Owners
You can change account Owners from the **General settings** screen.
The current account Owner and any member with the LaunchDarkly Billing Admin organization role can change which member has the Owner role. Only account members with verified LaunchDarkly accounts can become account Owners.
If you need to change which member has the Owner role in your LaunchDarkly account and do not have access to do so, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
##### Have your Owner credentials ready
If you have not authenticated to LaunchDarkly within the last 10 minutes, you will be prompted to re-enter your credentials during this procedure. Make sure you have access to the account Owner’s login information before you start.
To change account Owners:
 1. Log in to LaunchDarkly as the account Owner.
 2. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings. The General settings page appears.
 3. In the “Change owner” section, click your name. A menu of other account members appears.
 4. Choose a new account member from the menu by clicking or searching.
 5. Click **Update owner**. The “Sign in to LaunchDarkly” screen appears.
 6. Reauthenticate with your credentials. If your organization uses SSO or SCIM for LaunchDarkly, enter only your email to trigger SSO or SCIM authentication.
 7. After you authenticate, the General settings page appears.
 8. Select the same new account member as in step 4. A confirmation appears.
 9. Confirm that you want to update the account Owner by clicking **Change**.
Your role changes to Admin. The account member you chose now has the Owner base role.
