## Overview
This topic explains how to integrate LaunchDarkly with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). The Entra ID App Gallery includes LaunchDarkly and provides a LaunchDarkly application template that facilitates configuration.
If you want to set up SCIM provisioning with Entra ID, read [Configure SCIM](/docs/home/account/scim#configure-scim).
## Integrate LaunchDarkly with Entra ID
To integrate LaunchDarkly with Entra ID:
 1. Log in to Entra ID.
 2. Navigate to “Enterprise applications.”
 3. Click **New application** :
![The "Enterprise applications" page with "New application" called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/2880b545aaff4e7ea90979de26a46ccbfc01b08977a337e3024d348c136f13f0/assets/images/__third_party/entra-new-application.png)
The "Enterprise applications" page with "New application" called out.
 1. Search for the LaunchDarkly application.
 2. After you add it, follow the [Microsoft Entra integration with LaunchDarkly tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/launchdarkly-tutorial).
If your instance of Entra ID manages multiple LaunchDarkly accounts, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
##### Entra ID user identifier guidelines
During configuration, we recommend using the identifier `user.mail`, provided that every user has their email address attribute set. If you haven’t set attributes for every user, use the identifier `user.userprincipalname`.
After you set up the integration, log in to LaunchDarkly by clicking the LaunchDarkly app in Entra or through Microsoft’s [My App portal](https://myapplications.microsoft.com/). To learn more, read Microsoft’s [Sign in and start apps from the My Apps portal](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).
If members cannot log in after you set up SSO, read the troubleshooting article [New users are unable to log in with Entra (formerly Azure AD) once SSO is configured](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/articles/17256877142683-New-users-are-unable-to-log-in-with-Azure-AD-once-SSO-is-configured).
## Map custom roles to Entra User Attributes
After you integrate LaunchDarkly with Entra ID, you can map LaunchDarkly role and custom role attributes to Entra User Attributes using Entra claims. The LaunchDarkly Entra SSO integration provides Just-In-Time (JIT) user provisioning for IdP-Initiated SSO.
To learn more about SSO provisioning for roles, read [Roles](/docs/home/account/roles).
To set up `role` and `customRole` claims in Entra ID:
 1. In Entra ID, open the LaunchDarkly Enterprise Application.
 2. Click **Single sign-on**.
 3. Scroll to the “Attributes & Claims” section.
 4. Click **Edit**.
 5. Click **Add new claim**. The “Manage claim” screen appears:
![The "Manage claim" screen.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/79c87f0ad567eec58744b42a468944bb3340c1374dab57c54406d09169f38c7f/assets/images/__third_party/entra-manage-claim.png)
The "Manage claim" screen.
 1. Enter “role” in the **Name** field.
 2. Leave the source as “Attribute.”
 3. Choose a source attribute from the menu that is not currently mapped, such as `user.country`.
 4. Click **Save**.
 5. Repeat steps 5-9 with “customRole,” mapping to a different unused source attribute.
##### Removing existing roles
SAML ignores empty fields if used in **Roles** or **customRoles**. To clear all existing roles, enter an empty string "" into the field.
## Map custom roles to Entra Security Groups
In addition to Entra User Attributes, you can also assign LaunchDarkly custom roles to Entra Security Groups.
There are five steps to this process:
 1. [Create roles in LaunchDarkly](/docs/home/account/entra#create-roles-in-launchdarkly)
 2. [Create groups in Entra ID](/docs/home/account/entra#create-groups-in-entra-id)
 3. [Create roles for the Entra LaunchDarkly Enterprise Application](/docs/home/account/entra#create-roles-for-the-entra-launchdarkly-enterprise-application)
 4. [Set up groups and roles in the Entra LaunchDarkly Enterprise Application](/docs/home/account/entra#set-up-groups-and-roles-in-the-entra-launchdarkly-enterprise-application)
 5. [Update the Entra LaunchDarkly Enterprise Application SSO configuration](/docs/home/account/entra#update-the-entra-launchdarkly-enterprise-application-sso-configuration)
Each of these steps are outlined below.
### Create roles in LaunchDarkly
To begin, create the roles in LaunchDarkly that you want to use with the Entra LaunchDarkly Enterprise Application. Make note of each role’s key, as you will need the key when you set up your Entra ID app role.
To learn how, read [Roles](/docs/home/account/roles).
### Create groups in Entra ID
After you have created your custom roles in LaunchDarkly, set up your groups in Entra ID:
 1. In Entra ID, navigate to “Groups,” then click **New group**.
 2. Select a group type and enter a group name.
 3. Click “No members selected” to add new members:
![A new Entra ID group.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/a76405cd144fbd522f52d29eedb2e25f156cff35dd01739ba98ff8ee76bd4e6a/assets/images/__third_party/entra-new-group-members.png)
A new Entra ID group.
 1. Select members from the list to add to the group, then click **Select** :
![Adding members to a new Entra ID group.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/cd83d338ec7a5e09e2d82e2bbb912d8a4479b21136ad9d0ea6f6eaf6c1138275/assets/images/__third_party/entra-new-group-members-add.png)

The "All applications" tab on the "App registrations" page in Entra ID.
 1. Click **LaunchDarkly** to open the application.
 2. Navigate to “App roles” and click **Create app role**.
 3. Enter the role information. The **value** must be the key of the custom role you created during the [Create custom roles in LaunchDarkly](/docs/home/account/entra#create-roles-in-launchdarkly) step:
![A new role in Entra ID with the "Value" field called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/27c18cfe4ee00a2ffdbadb26bbbcaf846e0a4f00c8f7c566ae94f9c633bd1d97/assets/images/__third_party/azure-new-role.png)

For another example of this setup process, read [How to setup LaunchDarkly custom roles from Entra (formerly Azure AD) Security Groups](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/articles/17058194555291-How-to-setup-LaunchDarkly-custom-roles-from-Azure-AD-Security-Groups).
## Assign Entra ID Security Groups to LaunchDarkly teams
You can assign LaunchDarkly teams to Entra Security Groups. This keeps the members of your LaunchDarkly teams in sync with your Entra ID groups.
There are four steps to this process:
