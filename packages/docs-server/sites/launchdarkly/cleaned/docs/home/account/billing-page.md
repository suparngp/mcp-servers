## Overview
This topic explains the information on the **Billing** page and how to make changes to the LaunchDarkly plan you subscribe to.
The billing cycle begins on the first of the month (UTC). Your first month is prorated based on when you sign up.
## About the Billing page
Access the **Billing** page from the left navigation. Depending on how your LaunchDarkly account is configured, you may not have access to view the **Billing** page.
The **Billing** page includes the following information:
 * Your account ID.
 * The charges for the current month.
 * Your monthly entitlements for monthly active users (MAU) for the current month. To learn more, read [Monthly active users (MAU)](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing#monthly-active-users-mau).
 * Your monthly entitlements for [service connections](/docs/home/account/service-connections) for the current month.
 * (If applicable) Your monthly entitlements for [Experimentation keys](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing#experimentation-keys) or [Experimentation MAU](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing#experimentation-mau) and [Data Export events](/docs/integrations/data-export) for the current month.
 * (If applicable) Your monthly entitlements for the upcoming month, if you have made changes to your plan and the new billing cycle has not yet started.
 * Your billing contact information.
 * Your billing method.
 * Your billing history.
If you are not on a Foundation plan, the **Billing** page does not include service connections. Instead, it includes your total seat usage.
## Making changes to your plan
##### Plan options are customized for Enterprise and Guardian plans
If you’re on an Enterprise or Guardian plan, your plan options are customized to your usage needs and are not available from the **Billing** page. [Contact us](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/) for information about your plan options.
From the **Billing** page you can view your current usage, plan selections, billing information, and upgrade options.
### Subscription options
If you’re on a Foundation plan, your plan includes monthly entitlements for [service connections](/docs/home/account/service-connections) and for [contexts](/docs/home/flags/contexts). You have the option to pay monthly or annually.
If you choose to pay monthly, LaunchDarkly will bill you each month for the previous calendar month’s usage. If you need different plan options, find the “Plan details” section of the **Billing** page and click **Contact us**.
If you choose to pay annually, you’ll prepay for a year of usage. LaunchDarkly will also bill you at the beginning of each month for any usage in excess of the prepaid entitlements from the prior month. If you need different plan options, find the “Plan details” section of the **Billing** page and click **Get in touch**.
You can update your monthly entitlements at any time. To update your entitlements:
 1. Find the “Plan details” section of the **Billing** page and click **Modify**.
 2. In the “Customize your monthly entitlements” section, update the [service connections](/docs/home/account/service-connections) and [contexts](/docs/home/flags/contexts) for your primary context kind.
 3. Click **Proceed to checkout**. A “Review your subscription changes” screen appears.
 4. Click **Update subscription**.
To cancel your changes and return to the **Billing** page, click **Edit plan details** and then **Keep current plan**.
If you are on other plan types, then depending on your current plan type, you can:
 * View or adjust your seats
 * View or adjust your MAUs
 * Enable or disable SSO
 * Add Experimentation to your plan
 * Add Data Export to your plan
 * Add observability to your plan
 * Switch to a Foundation plan
To learn more about how LaunchDarkly plans compare to each other, click **Compare plans** , or read [Pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/).
### Change billing contact
To change the billing contact for your account:
 1. Find the “Billing contact” section of the **Billing** page.
 2. Click **Edit contact**.
 * You can update the name and address here.
 * The email for the billing contact is always the email of the account Owner. To change the account Owner, read [Changing account Owners](/docs/home/account/roles/owners).
 1. Click **Save**.
The account Owner or a member with the LaunchDarkly Billing Admin organization role can change the billing contact.
### Change billing method
To change the billing method for your account:
 1. Find the “Billing method” section of the **Billing** page.
 2. Click **Edit payment method**.
 3. Enter the new credit card information.
 4. Click **Save card**.
If you are currently billed by invoice, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to change your billing method.
### Cancel your subscription
To cancel your LaunchDarkly subscription:
 1. Find the “End subscription” section of the **Billing** page.
 2. Click **Cancel my subscription**.
 3. In the dialog, click **Cancel my subscription**.
Your account remains active through the remainder of your current billing cycle. If your usage during the remainder of your current billing cycle exceeds your prepaid entitlements, LaunchDarkly will bill you for that excess usage. After your current billing cycle concludes, no additional charges are incurred for your account.
If you are currently billed by invoice, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to cancel your subscription.
