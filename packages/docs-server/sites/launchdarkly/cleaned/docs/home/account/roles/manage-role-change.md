## Overview
This topic explains how to change the roles assigned to members in LaunchDarkly.
## Change individual member roles
To change an individual member’s roles, first find the member:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Members**. The **Members** list appears.
 3. Find the account member you wish to give a role.
 4. Click that account member’s name. The member’s **Access** tab opens.
To add an additional role to this member:
 1. In the “Assigned directly” table, click **Assign access**. The “Assign access” dialog appears.
 2. Choose a role from the dropdown.
 3. (Optional) If the role includes a [role attribute](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#role-attribute), enter a value for the attribute and click **Enter**. For example, if the role includes a [role scope](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#role-scope) with a role attribute of `developerProjectKey`, enter a project key in the **Resources** field:
![A member's "Assign access" dialog, with a role attribute and resource specified for the role being assigned to this member.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/517a06a22c6a2e4997d55a76258f80f33a4b70fd34648d3e20e45c34f444c00a/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/assign-access-member-role-attr.png)
A member's "Assign access" dialog, with a role attribute and resource specified for the role being assigned to this member.
 4. Click **Assign access**. You are returned to the **Access** tab.
To change an existing role assigned to this member:
 1. In the “Assigned directly” table, find the role that you want to change.
 2. Click the **three-dot** overflow menu next to that role.
 3. Select **Edit access**. The “Assign access” dialog appears.
 4. Select a different role for the member, or update the existing role:
 * Choose a different role from the dropdown.
 * If an existing role includes a [role attribute](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#role-attribute), you can update the value for that role attribute without changing the role. For example, if the role includes a [role scope](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#role-scope) with a role attribute of `developerProjectKey`, you can enter a new project key in the **Resources** field and click **Enter** to change the key. Or you can click the **x** to remove an existing project key:
![A member's "Assign access" dialog, with a role attribute and resource specified for the role being assigned to this member.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/517a06a22c6a2e4997d55a76258f80f33a4b70fd34648d3e20e45c34f444c00a/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/assign-access-member-role-attr.png)
A member's "Assign access" dialog, with a role attribute and resource specified for the role being assigned to this member.
 5. Click **Assign access**. The member’s access is updated.

You can also use the REST API: [Modify an account member](/docs/api/account-members/patch-member)
## Change multiple members’ roles
##### Changing multiple members' roles is an Admin-only feature
This feature is only accessible if you have a LaunchDarkly Admin organization role, or an Admin or Owner base role, or another role that allows the `updateCustomRole` action. To learn more, read [About member roles](/docs/home/account/members#about-member-roles) and [Member actions](/docs/home/account/roles/role-actions#member-actions).
To change multiple members’ roles:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Members**. The **Members** list appears.
 3. Select the checkbox to the left of a member’s name to choose that member. Select all members whose roles you wish to edit. Alternatively, if you wish to select all the members, click the checkbox next to the **Name** column in the table.
 4. Next to the **Export CSV** button, another button appears that says **Edit N members** , where N is the number of members that you selected:
![The "Edit N members" button.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/e828581478e53ab4aae0ce8c2352195b76b8b6b0694d13b0827debcb6c6b9573/assets/images/auto/edit-n-members-button.auto.png)
The "Edit N members" button.
 1. Click the **Edit N members** button and select the “Edit member roles” option. A dialog appears.
![The "Edit member roles" option](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/697346a4d55a2c44941b9177982d8e4977c18ef6681aa63fcd43967947bad0aa/assets/images/auto/edit-member-roles-option.auto.png)
The "Edit member roles" option
 1. Select one of the roles and click **Replace role**. LaunchDarkly attempts to replace any of the roles on the members that you selected to the new roles. Roles that have been assigned at the team level do not change.
When you select all members, the number of members may not match the number of members that appears at the top of the **Members** tab. This happens because you cannot perform bulk edit actions on yourself or the Owner of the account.
