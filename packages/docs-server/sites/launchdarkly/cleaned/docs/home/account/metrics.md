## Overview
This topic explains how to understand the metrics visualized on the **Plan usage** and **Diagnostic usage** pages, and how your usage relates to the LaunchDarkly plan you subscribe to.
For additional details on how LaunchDarkly calculates billing based on your usage, read [Calculating billing](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing).
## About the usage pages
To view plan usage metrics, click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings. Then choose **Plan usage**. These usage metrics tell you how much of your allotted usage, as defined in your plan, your account is using.
To view diagnostic usage metrics, choose **Diagnostic usage**. These usage metrics tell you more about how your application and members of your organization are using LaunchDarkly.
## Plan usage
The **Plan usage** page may contain some or all of the following charts, depending on your plan.
### Plan overview
The **Overview** tab displays:
 * **Seats** : The number of member seats used.
 * **Remaining this month** : The number of seats, client-side MAU, Data Export events, service connections, and Experimentation keys, event, or MAU remaining for the month.
 * The “Remaining this month” section lists client-side MAU at the account level, while the **Client-side MAU** tab displays all the MAU from each named project or from each named environment. If the same context is present in multiple environments or projects, it still counts only once toward your MAU count.
 * Summary cards for your service connections, client-side MAU, Experimentation, and Data Export usage for the month.
Click **View details** on any of the summary cards to view detailed usage charts.

The plan usage page.
### Service connections
The **Service connections** tab displays the cumulative number of service connections your account has used over your billing period.
A service connection is one instance of one server-side SDK connected to one LaunchDarkly environment for a time period measured in minutes. To learn more, read [Service connections](/docs/home/account/service-connections).
You can narrow the chart view in the following ways:
 * **Dimension** : You can display individual charts by project, environment, connection type, relay version, and SDK name, type, or version.
 * **Date range** : You can view the last three days, last 30 days, month-to-date, or last three months. Use the month/year dropdown to view the billing period for a specific month.
 * **Cumulative** or **Incremental** : When viewing a range of a month or less:
 * Select **Cumulative** to display the total service connections for the billing period so far.
 * Select **Incremental** to display the service connections for each individual day within the billing period.
You can also view which applications are consuming Service Connections by sending application metadata from your SDKs. When configured, this metadata appears in the **Usage** pages to help identify application-level consumption. To learn how to send application metadata, read [Application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config).
If you subscribe to a LaunchDarkly plan, you commit to a certain number of service connections each month. LaunchDarkly will also bill you at the beginning of each month for any usage in excess of these prepaid entitlements from the prior month. You can change your monthly entitlements from the **Billing** page. To learn more, read [The Billing page](/docs/home/account/billing-page).
You can also view your monthly accumulated usage as of the current date on the [Diagnostic usage](/docs/home/account/metrics#diagnostic-usage) page.
The **Service connections** tab may appear on the **Plan usage** tab or the **Diagnostic usage** tab.
### Client-side MAU
The **Client-side MAU** tab displays MAU from client-side and edge SDKs.
You can narrow the chart view in the following ways:
 * **Dimension** : You can display individual charts by project, environment, SDK name, SDK app ID, or anonymous contexts.
 * **Date range** : You can view the last 30 days, month-to-date, or last three months. Use the month/year dropdown to view the billing period for a specific month.
 * **Cumulative** , **Incremental** , or **Rolling 30D** : When viewing a range of a month or less:
 * Select **Cumulative** to display the total MAU for the billing period so far.
 * Select **Incremental** to display the MAU for each individual day within the billing period.
 * Select **Rolling 30D** to display a rolling count of MAU over the billing period.
You can also view your monthly accumulated usage as of the current date on the [Diagnostic usage](/docs/home/account/metrics#diagnostic-usage) page.
### Experimentation keys or MAU
The **Experimentation** tab displays information about your Experimentation keys or MAU, depending on your billing model.
#### Experimentation keys
If you are billed by Experimentation keys, the **Experimentation keys** tab displays each day’s cumulative number of Experimentation keys for the current calendar month.
You can narrow the chart view in the following ways:
 * **Dimension** : You can display individual charts by project or environment.
 * **Date range** : You can view the last three days, the last 30 days, month-to-date, or last three months. Use the month/year dropdown to view the billing period for a specific month.
 * **Cumulative** , **Incremental** : When viewing a range of a month or less:
 * Select **Cumulative** to display the total keys for the billing period so far.
 * Select **Incremental** to display the keys for each individual day within the billing period.
Experimentation keys include the total number of unique context keys, from server-side, client-side, AI, and edge SDKs, included in each experiment:
 * if the same context key is in one experiment multiple times, LaunchDarkly counts it as one Experimentation key
 * if the same context key is in two different experiments, LaunchDarkly counts it as two Experimentation keys
If you subscribe to a LaunchDarkly plan, you commit to a certain number of Experimentation keys each month. LaunchDarkly will also bill you at the beginning of each month for any usage in excess of these prepaid entitlements from the prior month. You can change your monthly entitlements from the **Billing** page. To learn more, read [The Billing page](/docs/home/account/billing-page).
#### Experimentation MAU
Some customers are billed by Experimentation MAU, which is the number of unique monthly active users who encounter LaunchDarkly server-side, client-side, AI, and edge SDKs, and who have the potential to be included in an experiment. To learn more, read [Experimentation MAU](/docs/home/account/calculating-billing#experimentation-mau).
You can narrow the chart view in the following ways:
 * **Dimension** : You can display individual charts by project, environment, SDK name, SDK app ID, or anonymous contexts.
