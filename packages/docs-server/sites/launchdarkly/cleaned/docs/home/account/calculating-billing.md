## Overview
This topic explains how LaunchDarkly calculates billing for your account.
LaunchDarkly calculates your billing based on different aspects of your system usage. Depending on your billing model, you may be billed for more than one of the account usage metrics displayed on the Usage page.
For example, Foundation, Enterprise, and Guardian plans can include monthly entitlements for MAU, service connections, observability, and Experimentation keys.
LaunchDarkly will bill you at the beginning of each month for any usage in excess of these entitlements from the prior month. Throughout each month, LaunchDarkly sends an email notification to your account owner and your account’s billing contact when your overage balance exceeds various dollar amounts.
## Monthly active users (MAU)
##### MAU was previously called "primary contexts"
Previously, we used “primary contexts” to determine costs and billing. As of December 19, 2024 we have updated the name of this billing metric to “MAU.” Your usage charts on the [Usage page](/docs/home/account/metrics) have been updated to reflect this name change, but there was no change to your billing or pricing.
MAU is the number of unique monthly active users who encounter LaunchDarkly client-side and edge SDKs. For most customers, we use monthly active users (MAU) to help determine your bill every month.
Your usage is based on the total number of unique MAU across your entire account. Uniqueness is defined by unique context `key`s. If you change an existing context’s key, LaunchDarkly considers the new context unique and counts it as an additional MAU. Custom attributes do not affect uniqueness.
If you subscribe to a LaunchDarkly plan, you commit to a certain number of unique MAU each month.
### MAU for context kinds other than user
For most LaunchDarkly customers, MAU is the number of monthly active `user`s.
The majority of LaunchDarkly customers use the `user` context kind the most. However, if your greatest-used context kind is something other than `user`, then your MAU is calculated based on that kind. For example:
 * If you use 2,000,000 `users` and 500,000 `devices`, your MAU will be 2,000,000, based on `user`.
 * If you use 2,000,000 `users` and 4,000,000 `devices`, your MAU will be 4,000,000, based on `device`.
### MAU limits
The LaunchDarkly plan you subscribe to may include a MAU limit. We understand that a company’s customer base can grow unexpectedly over time. We never stop or throttle service if you exceed your MAU limit. All contexts will continue to receive feature flags correctly, regardless of the amount of your MAU.
Context instances live on the **Contexts** list for 30 days from their last evaluation, or until the environment reaches 3,000,000 context instances. To learn more, read [Manage stored contexts](/docs/home/flags/contexts-list#manage-stored-contexts).
If you have configured LaunchDarkly to use anonymous contexts, that can impact your MAU as well. To learn more, read [Manage anonymous contexts](/docs/home/flags/anonymous-contexts#manage-anonymous-contexts).
To learn more about your client-side usage billing model, contact your LaunchDarkly representative.
## Service connections
Some customers are billed by service connections. A service connection is one instance of one server-side SDK connected to one LaunchDarkly environment for a time period measured in minutes. To learn more, read [Service connections](/docs/home/account/service-connections).
If you subscribe to a LaunchDarkly plan, you commit to a certain number of service connections each month. LaunchDarkly will also bill you at the beginning of each month for any usage in excess of these prepaid entitlements from the prior month. You can change your monthly entitlements from the **Billing** page. To learn more, read [The Billing page](/docs/home/account/billing-page).
## Experimentation
Depending on your billing model, if you use Experimentation, you may be be billed by Experimentation keys or Experimentation MAU. If you are unsure how you are being billed for Experimentation, contact your LaunchDarkly representative.
### Experimentation keys
Some customers are billed by Experimentation keys.
Experimentation keys include the total number of unique context keys, from server-side, client-side, AI, and edge SDKs, included in each experiment:
 * if the same context key is in one experiment multiple times, LaunchDarkly counts it as one Experimentation key
 * if the same context key is in two different experiments, LaunchDarkly counts it as two Experimentation keys
Your total usage of Experimentation keys measures how many contexts you are targeting in your experiments.
If you subscribe to a LaunchDarkly plan, you commit to a certain number of Experimentation keys each month. LaunchDarkly will also bill you at the beginning of each month for any usage in excess of these prepaid entitlements from the prior month. You can change your monthly entitlements from the **Billing** page. To learn more, read [The Billing page](/docs/home/account/billing-page).
For some annual billing plans, you commit to a certain number of Experimentation keys each month. If you consistently go over your plan limits, averaged over a quarter, we will “true forward” your contract based on your actual average use. To learn more about your Experimentation billing plan, contact your LaunchDarkly representative.
### Experimentation MAU
Some customers are billed by Experimentation MAU.
Experimentation MAU is the number of unique monthly active users who encounter LaunchDarkly server-side, client-side, AI, and edge SDKs, and who have the potential to be included in an experiment. Generally, [anonymous](/docs/home/flags/anonymous-contexts) server-side users cannot be included in experiments, so are not included in Experimentation MAU.
This number is based on the total number of unique MAU across your entire account, whether or not they encounter an experiment in that month. Uniqueness is defined by unique context `key`s. If you change an existing context’s key, LaunchDarkly considers the new context unique and counts it as an additional MAU. Custom attributes do not affect uniqueness.
If a user is included in more than one experiment within a month, it still counts as one MAU.
## Observability
If you subscribe to a LaunchDarkly plan, you are entitled to a certain number of observability products each month. LaunchDarkly will bill you at the beginning of each month for any usage in excess of these prepaid entitlements from the prior month.
The LaunchDarkly observability feature is billed by the following products:
 * Monthly ingested sessions
 * Monthly ingested errors
 * Monthly ingested traces
 * Monthly ingested logs
To estimate your monthly costs for observability, use our [observability usage calculator](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/#observability-calculator).
## Identifying causes of unexpected high bills
Billing issues can be complex and unique to your account. As a best practice, we recommend taking questions about your LaunchDarkly bill to your LaunchDarkly representative.
However, customers on Foundation plans or who otherwise do not have access to a LaunchDarkly representative may find it helpful to understand how to investigate unexpected high bills. A common cause of unexpected high bills is incorrectly implemented SDKs. In almost all cases, we recommend that you implement SDKs in a [singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).
### Symptoms of not following the singleton pattern
An incorrectly implemented SDK can result in a number of different symptoms. Common symptoms include:
 * Large number of service connections
 * Increased CPU or memory usage
 * Frequent connectivity errors, such as connection timeouts or dropped connections
 * Experiments missing events
 * Flags reflecting default or stale values because they are unable to connect to LaunchDarkly
### Correctly implementing the singleton pattern
Here are some best practices for correctly implementing the singleton pattern:
 * Create a singleton for the SDK and make sure it’s reused throughout your application.
 * Inject the singleton into dependent classes, or pass it explicitly, rather than instantiating it directly.
 * Centralize SDK initialization so you initialize one time, during application setup, and reuse the SDK client through the lifecycle.
 * Lazy load safely. In some SDKs, the initialization method returns a promise. Make sure to either set your `client` variable to the actual initialized SDK client, or wait for the promise to resolve.
### Identifying incorrect SDK implementations
There are two common coding patterns that result in the unintentional creation of multiple SDK instances. These patterns are:
 * Over-instantiation: In this situation, you unintentionally create multiple instances. This can lead to inflated service connection costs and may contribute to performance issues as you scale.
 * Runaway instantiation: In this situation, you unintentionally create new instances throughout the lifespan of your application. This can lead to explosive service connection costs and nearly always cause performance issues, regardless of scale.
Examples of over-instantiation include:
 * Instantiating in multiple classes. In this case, each service creates its own SDK instance, which results in multiple unnecessary connections.
 * Improperly implemented lazy loading. In some SDKs, the `initLDClient` function returns a promise. If you use a helper method to set `ldClient` to that promise rather than to the actual initialized SDK client, then you can end up with multiple SDK instances by making multiple calls to your helper method before the first `initLDClient` call resolves. This can lead to unexpected behavior or resource overuse. This asynchronous gap can also cause problems in applications where proper initialization and single-instance management of the SDK are critical. The SDK is designed to be initialized once per application instance, so it is important to ensure proper lazy loading without redundant initializations.
Examples of runaway instantiation include:
 * Instantiating inside a loop or recurring function. In this case, each iteration of the loop or function creates a new SDK instance, which results in a large number of unnecessary connections.
 * Instantiating in a request handler or other short-lived context. In this case, a new SDK instance is created for each request, which results in a large number of unnecessary connections.
