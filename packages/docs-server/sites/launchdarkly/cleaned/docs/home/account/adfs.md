## Overview
This topic explains how to configure SSO integration between a self-hosted Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server and LaunchDarkly.
ADFS is a service provided by Microsoft as a standard role for Windows Server. It provides a web login using existing Active Directory credentials.
##### Troubleshooting ADFS-based SSO
If you need information about ADFS errors during configuration, troubleshoot it by accessing the ADFS logs in the Windows Event Viewer.
## Prerequisites
To give your organization access to LaunchDarkly through ADFS, you need the following components:
 * An Enterprise LaunchDarkly account.
 * A signed SSL certificate.
 * An Active Directory instance where all users have an email address attribute.
 * A Microsoft Server instance with ADFS installed and configured.
##### Setting up ADFS
This topic does not tell you how to set up ADFS. To learn how to set up ADFS, read [Microsoft’s documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/deployment-administrators-guide/hh699811\(v=crm.8\)).
## Set up LaunchDarkly fields
Here is a table explaining LaunchDarkly fields:
LaunchDarkly field | Notes 
---|--- 
Sign-on URL | Copy the Token Signing certificate to a Base-64 encoded x.509 file and import it into LaunchDarkly 
X.509 certificate | Default value: `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/adfs/ls/[](https://your-domain/adfs/ls/)`. 
If the default value fails, confirm that the endpoint is enabled and the URL path is correct. 
Find the endpoint in Service, then Endpoints. Search for an endpoint with the ` SAML 2.0/WS-Federation ` type. 
For more information on configuring LaunchDarkly’s SSO, read [Single sign-on](/docs/home/account/sso).
## Add Relying Party Trust
To add the Relying Party Trust:
 1. Log into the ADFS Management tool.
 2. Click **Add Relying Party Trust…**. The Add Relying Party Trust Wizard appears:
![The ADFS Management tool, with the "Add Relying Party Trust..." option called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/1940a72bd3d05cd7ced09a6c22f42fcdedaa020208f20658b157e7db7d9c7506/assets/images/__third_party/adfs-add-party-trust.png)
The ADFS Management tool, with the "Add Relying Party Trust..." option called out.
 1. Click **Start**. Keep the default value, which is **Claims aware** :
![The "Welcome" screen for the setup wizard.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/aa2224bb8a4229301dd4a8b878e2a75b45b120fd5d10e0e6ce7e469d7233bd3f/assets/images/__third_party/adfs-wizard-claims-aware.png)
The "Welcome" screen for the setup wizard.
 1. Choose **Enter data about the relying party manually** :
![The Select Data Source screen.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/99289ab88091726ec7a624e45e9de96c0b8fc84f8dd415829e79c1e50636cbb9/assets/images/__third_party/adfs-wizard-enter-data-manually.png)
The Select Data Source screen.
 1. Click **Next**. The “Specify Display Name” screen appears.
 2. Set a display name of your choosing.
 3. Click **Next**. The “Configure Certificate” screen appears.
 4. You do not need to choose a certificate. Click **Next**.
 5. Select **Enable support for the SAML 2.0 WebSSO protocol**.
 6. Enter the **Assertion consumer service URL** from the SSO section of LaunchDarkly into the **Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL** field.
 7. Click **Next**.
 8. In the **Relying party trust identifier** field, enter `app.launchdarkly.com`.
 9. Click **Add**.
 10. Click **Next**. The “Choose Access control Policy” screen appears.
 11. You do not need to change any access control policies. Click **Next**.
 12. Review your changes and click **Next**.
 13. If you are satisfied with the configuration, click **Close**.
After you have successfully completed this procedure, a new LaunchDarkly trust will appear in the ADFS Management tool.
## Set up claim issuance policies
To set up a claim issuance policy:
 1. Log into the ADFS Management tool.
 2. Select the **LaunchDarkly Trust**.
 3. Click **Edit Claim Issuance Policy…** in the menu. The “Edit Claim Issuance Policy” window appears.
 4. Click **Add Rule**.
 5. Set **Claim rule template** to “Transform an Incoming Claim.”
 6. Click **Next** :
![The "Select Rule Template" screen.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/c5d0926499c21d09450ed2bf288d3159c99733dbf47f933cd0876a7f68518749/assets/images/__third_party/adfs-select-rule-template.png)
The "Select Rule Template" screen.
 1. Set the following options:
 * Claim rule name: Enter a human-readable name, such as “Email to NameID.”
 * Incoming claim type: **E-Mail Address**
 * Outgoing claim type: **Name ID**
 * Outgoing name ID format: **Email**
 1. Select **Pass through all claim values**.
 2. Click **Finish**.
ADFS is now configured with LaunchDarkly.
For more information on claim rules, read Microsoft’s [Create a Rule to Transform an Incoming Claim](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-rule-to-transform-an-incoming-claim).
### Configure custom roles
You can map LaunchDarkly custom role attributes to ADFS using a claim issuance policy. To learn more about SSO provisioning for roles, read [Roles](/docs/home/account/roles).
Before you can map custom role attributes, you must get your ADFS groups. To learn how, read Microsoft’s Microsoft’s [Create a Rule to Send Claims Using a Custom Rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-rule-to-send-claims-using-a-custom-rule).
Your rule will look something like this:
![The "Edit Rule" window.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/7cebfba1e223664e819395fd2d6dc0b6dc8820df35ef0a0c3cc0d8fe0341c524/assets/images/__third_party/adfs-get-groups.png)
The "Edit Rule" window.
To send claims using a custom rule:
 1. Log into the ADFS Management tool.
 2. Select **LaunchDarkly Trust**.
 3. Click **Edit Claim Issuance Policy…** in the menu. The “Edit Claim Issuance Policy” window appears.
 4. Click **Add Rule**.
 5. Set **Claim rule template** to **Send Claims using a custom rule**.
 6. Click **Next**.
 7. Enter a human-readable name, such as “Map groups to LD custom roles.”
 8. In the Custom rule window, enter the following:
ADFS
```
c:[Type == "http://temp/variable"] 
--- 
 => issue(Type = "customRole", Value = c.Value) 
```
Here is an image of the custom rule:
![A custom rule entered in the "Edit Rule" window.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/550f795b4b35a5b856d929ef4facd909993c0b852a9811cf98fcaba2c4915aa1/assets/images/__third_party/adfs-map-groups-to-roles.png)
A custom rule entered in the "Edit Rule" window.
 1. Click **OK**.
You can now assign ADFS members to custom role groups using the “Member of” tab within user properties.
##### Removing existing roles
SAML ignores empty fields if used in **Roles** or **customRoles**. To clear all existing roles, enter an empty string "" into the field.
## Test drive and enable
After you successfully complete the procedures in this topic, you can log in through ADFS when test-drive mode is enabled. To learn more, read [Test-drive mode](/docs/home/account/saml#test-drive-mode).
If you are able to successfully log in with test-drive mode enabled, you can enable SSO for the rest of your organization. To learn more, read [Single sign-on](/docs/home/account/sso).
