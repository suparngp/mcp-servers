## Overview
This topic explains how the version of LaunchDarkly that is available on domains residing in the European Union (EU) is different from the version of LaunchDarkly available in the United States. The LaunchDarkly EU instance complies with EU data residency principles, including the protection and confidentiality of EU customer information.
To comply with these data principles, the LaunchDarkly EU instance includes additional controls on its infrastructure and security configurations. These controls allow management of customer data flows that are not available in the US instance of LaunchDarkly. The EU instance resides in the AWS Frankfurt (`eu-central-1`) region and operates nearly the same as the US instance of LaunchDarkly. Operational monitoring with Datadog and edge delivery/CDN (Fastly) still operate from regions within the United States.
The EU instance only supports net new Enterprise and Guardian plan accounts and LaunchDarkly trials.
## The EU version of this docs site
You can view an EU instance-specific version of this documentation site.
The EU version of the docs site is different from the standard version in the following ways:
 * EU instance URLs display with `.eu` URLs, including within code samples. To learn more, read [EU instance URLs](/docs/home/infrastructure/eu#eu-instance-urls).
 * Features and integrations that the EU instance does not support are marked with a warning message. To learn more, read [Supported features](/docs/home/infrastructure/eu#supported-features).
To view the EU instance-specific version of this documentation site, change the site version menu to “EU docs”.
## Supported features
The EU instance supports the following features:
 * Core flagging features through the LaunchDarkly application and API
 * [Code references](/docs/home/flags/code-references)
 * [Guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts)
 * The [LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy](/docs/sdk/relay-proxy)
 * [Live events](/docs/home/releases/live-events)
 * [Metrics](/docs/home/metrics)
 * [Experimentation](/docs/home/experimentation)
 * Most [SDKs](/docs/sdk)
 * [Single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/home/account/sso)
 * Some [flag imports](/docs/home/flags/import)
The EU instance does not currently support the following features:
 * [Launch Insights](/docs/home/getting-started/launch-insights)
 * [All Edge SDKs](/docs/sdk/edge)
 * [The Roku SDK](/docs/sdk/client-side/roku)
 * LaunchDarkly inbox notifications for [approval requests](/docs/home/releases/approval-requests)
 * [The Billing page](/docs/home/account/billing-page)
 * [Migration flags](/docs/home/flags/migration)
 * The [support chatbot](/docs/home/getting-started/feature-management#additional-resources)
 * [Debugging guarded rollout errors](/docs/home/releases/errors)
### Integrations available in the EU instance
Integrations connect LaunchDarkly to other systems and move data between them. Only the following connected systems are currently enabled.
The EU instance initially will only support customer requested integrations. Requested integrations are provisioned shortly after each request. The following integrations are enabled:
 * [Datadog flag triggers](/docs/integrations/datadog/triggers)
 * [Datadog events](/docs/integrations/datadog/events)
 * [Dynatrace flag triggers](/docs/guides/integrations/triggers-dynatrace)
 * [Honeycomb events](/docs/integrations/honeycomb/events)
 * [Jira](/docs/integrations/jira)
 * [ServiceNow approvals](/docs/integrations/servicenow)
 * [Segment](/docs/integrations/metric-segment)
 * [Slack](/docs/integrations/slack)
 * [Snowflake Data Export](/docs/integrations/data-export/snowflake)
## EU instance URLs
The EU instance, including the LaunchDarkly application, the instance API, and SDK use the base domain `eu.launchdarkly.com` in the URL path. If your network uses application or network layer firewalls, you must update them to allow these URLs. If you do not do this, LaunchDarkly will not function properly.
These URLs are:
 * `https://app.eu.launchdarkly.com`
 * `https://clientsdk.eu.launchdarkly.com`
 * `https://clientstream.eu.launchdarkly.com`
 * `https://events.eu.launchdarkly.com`
 * `https://sdk.eu.launchdarkly.com`
 * `https://stream.eu.launchdarkly.com`
To learn how to configure your SDK correctly using these endpoints, read [Service endpoint configuration](/docs/sdk/features/service-endpoint-configuration).
## Initialize an SDK for the EU instance
You can initialize an SDK for the EU instance using the initialization options for the SDK.
Depending on the SDK, you may need to configure multiple service endpoints in the initialization options. These could include the base and polling endpoint, streaming endpoint, and events endpoint. Server-side SDKs normally require streaming and events settings, not polling. For a list of available service endpoints, read [EU instance URLs](/docs/home/infrastructure/eu#eu-instance-urls).
The details of how to set these options differ between SDKs, as LaunchDarkly respects each language’s URI and URL naming conventions and supported services. For this reason, it is critical to reference the documentation for each individual SDK.
