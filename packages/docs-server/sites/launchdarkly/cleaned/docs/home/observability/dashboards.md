##### This feature is in Early Access
LaunchDarkly’s observability features are publicly available in early access. Enable observability in the billing page.
They currently require the LaunchDarkly [observability SDKs](/docs/sdk/observability) and the JavaScript, React Web, or Vue SDK.
If you are interested in participating in the Early Access Program for our upcoming observability plugins for server-side SDKs, [sign up here](https://launchdarkly.com/early-access/).
## Overview
This topic explains how to use dashboards in LaunchDarkly observability.
Dashboards let you visualize what’s happening in your app. They can show error rates, APM trends, user engagement, and more. Dashboards are comprised of graphs, which are visualizations of data that you can create and configure to show the data you want.
![An example dashboard.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/5acb48d1c15781fbab7bf92cb4c6dcbd31ad799a8b567bcac6a2a0c49131d844/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/o11y-dashboard-example.png)
An example dashboard.
## Create a dashboard
Here’s how to create a dashboard:
 1. In the LaunchDarkly UI, click **Dashboards** in the left sidenav.
 2. Click **Create new dashboard**.
 3. Give your dashboard a human-readable **Name**.
 4. Click the dropdown to choose the **Dashboard type** :
 * A **Blank dashboard** is initially empty. Use the [Add graphs to a dashboard](/docs/home/observability/dashboards#add-graphs-to-a-dashboard) procedure, below, to populate it.
 * A **Frontend metrics** dashboard is configured to include graphs for web vitals, browser memory, HTTP response size, HTTP request size, HTTP errors, and HTTP request latency.
 5. Click **Create**.
The new dashboard appears. For each **Dashboard type** , you can customize or remove graphs, and add additional graphs, to meet your reporting needs.
## Add graphs to a dashboard
You can add graphs to a dashboard to visualize different data.
First, name the graph and specify how you want the data to display. Here’s how:
 1. In a dashboard, click **+ Add graph**. The “New graph” page appears.
 2. Give your graph a human-readable **Graph title**.
 3. Choose the “View type” to specify how you want the graph to display data. The options are a line chart, a bar chart / histogram, or a table.
 4. (Optional) Select how to stack visualizations, which lets you compare amounts from multiple sources.
 * For line charts, click **Stack area** to display multiple areas stacked on top of each other.
 * For bar charts, click **Stack bars** to display multiple bars stacked on top of each other.
 5. (Optional) Specify how to handle **Nulls** or empty values. For line charts, nulls can be graphed as hidden, connected, or zero. For tables, nulls can be displayed as hidden, blank, or zero.
 * **Hidden** means nulls are not displayed.
 * **Connected** means if two non-empty values have empty or null values between them, the two non-empty values are graphed with a connecting line.
 * **Blank** means nulls are displayed as blank rows in a table.
 * **Zero** means nulls or empty values are displayed as having a zero value.
![The name and visualization section of the add graph panel.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/3c3bc2486a96b3bbad91f6fb14a07fabf3860639b825fd5f71338c14cba3ce9c/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/o11y-dashboard-naming.png)
The name and visualization section of the add graph panel.
Next, build a query to populate the graph with data. Here’s how:
 1. Select how to build a query:
 * Choose **Query Builder** to use the graph editor UI to query the data for your graph.
 * Choose **SQL Editor** to write a custom query with SQL. If you use this option, disregard steps 2 though 5. After you write a query, click **Run query**. To learn more, read [SQL Editor](/docs/home/observability/dashboards#sql-editor), below.
 2. Choose a **Source** from the dropdown. You can populate each graph with data from sessions, errors, logs, or traces.
 3. (Optional) Enter **Filters** to select which data points to include in your graph. For example, if you only want to include data from the production environment, set the `environment` filter. To learn more about the filter syntax, read [Search specification](/docs/home/observability/search).
 4. (Optional) Select a **Function** from the dropdown to determine how data points are aggregated. “Count” is selected by default. If you choose a function, such as “Min,” that requires a parameter, select the attribute to use as well.
 5. (Optional) To add an additional function, click **Add function**.
![The query builder section of the add graph panel.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/4944455ca8cb653d452d69cc178953b9c7105ca5869212e7e60a40f38c0dade4/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/o11y-dashboard-querybuilder.png)
The query builder section of the add graph panel.
Then, choose options to group the data. Here’s how:
 1. (Optional) Enable the **Group by** toggle to group your query results into separate series. Use the dropdown to choose the category by which to group results. For example, you might group your logs by level.
 2. (Optional) Specify a **Limit** to restrict the number of groups displayed, and a function type by which to determine if a group should be included in the graph.
 3. (Optional) Toggle **Bucket by** to use buckets in your graph. Then select **Interval** or **Count** to indicate how bucket sizes should be determined.
 * Bucketing by interval requires that you set a **Bucket interval**. A higher value displays more granular buckets.
 * Bucketing by count requires that you set a **Bucket field** and number of **Buckets** to group by.
 * For example, you might choose to bucket by **Count** with a **Bucket field** of “Timestamp” if you want to aggregate data points within consecutive time ranges. Or you might choose to bucket by **Count** with a **Bucket field** of “duration” if you want to examine the distribution of latency for a particular API endpoint. Or you might toggle **Bucket by** off to disable bucketing and aggregate data across your entire time range.
![The grouping section of the add graph panel.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/36d2cf8585d163980084af0b395fc0b8bd478e806298f30f440b3bd18e30b6cc/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/o11y-dashboard-grouping.png)
The grouping section of the add graph panel.
Finally, click **Save**. The new graph appears in the dashboard.
### Advanced graph creation tools
The graph editor provides two advanced graph creation tools: the SQL Editor, which you can use to query data for your graph, and dashboard variables, which you can use to parameterize graphs.
#### SQL Editor
The SQL editor lets you write custom queries to retrieve your data and aggregate as you wish. Using the SQL editor is an alternative to using the graphical query builder.
###### Expand Use SQL Editor to retrieve graph data
When you are creating or updating a graph for your dashboard, you can choose **SQL editor** to write a custom query with SQL.
The SQL editor includes the following features and limitations:
 * The SQL editor supports the ClickHouse SQL dialect. To learn more, read the [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference).
 * The built-in macro `$time_interval(<duration>)` expands to `toStartOfInterval(Timestamp, <duration>)`. You can use this macro to group results by their timestamp, which makes time series queries easier to write. Here’s an example that returns a count of logs for every hour:
Example using $time_interval macro
```
1
| SELECT $time_interval('1 hour'), count()
---|--- 
2
| FROM logs
3
| WHERE service_name='prod'
4
| GROUP BY 1
```
 * The dashboard’s data range is automatically applied as a filter to all SQL queries. For example, if your graph uses `SELECT count() from logs` and your dashboard’s filter is `Last 4 hours`, your resulting graph will only include logs within the last four hours. If you use a `WHERE` clause, it will filter in addition to the dashboard’s date range filter, and it will not include results outside that range.
 * The SQL editor only supports a single `SELECT` query. However, you can include multiple select expressions. This displays multiple series on your graph. Here’s an example that returns an hourly count and average duration of all traces:
Example querying multiple series
```
1
| SELECT $time_interval('1 hour'), count(), avg(duration)
---|--- 
2
| FROM traces
3
| GROUP BY 1
```
 * LaunchDarkly stores custom fields and metadata without any type information. You should convert this data to the appropriate type in your SQL queries. Here’s an example where your application records a custom integer field to record how many items are in an end user’s shopping cart:
Example applying type conversion
```
1
| SELECT email, avg(toInt64(cart_size))
---|--- 
2
| FROM sessions
3
| GROUP BY 1
4
| ORDER BY 2 DESC
5
| LIMIT 100
```
 * You can use aliases in your SQL queries so that your data is graphed with custom labels. Here’s an example:
Example using alias to create custom labels
```
1
| SELECT uniqExact(email) as "User Count"
---|--- 
2
| FROM sessions
```
#### Dashboard variables
Dashboard variables let you parameterize filters, bucketing, and grouping across multiple graphs. This makes it easier to make changes to sets of graphs at one time. After you create a dashboard variable, you can reference it in any of the filter, function, grouping, or bucketing rules components of the graph editor.
###### Expand Use dashboard variables in your graphs
You can create and edit dashboard variables from the dashboard or from the edit page for any graph.
Here’s how:
 1. From the dashboard or the edit page of a graph, click **Variables**. The “Variables” dialog appears.
 2. Click **+ New variable**.
 3. Enter a **Name** for the variable.
 4. Select a **Suggestion type** for the variable. The following table describes the options:
Suggestion type | Possible variable values | Behavior | Example 
---|---|---|--- 
Value | Any of the possible values for the **Suggestion field**. | With a “Value” suggestion, you must also select a **Suggestion field** , which is a search key. The variable’s **Default value** is any of the possible values for that key. When you use the variable in a graph, you set the value of the variable using a multiselect with all possible values for that key. A filter resulting from multiple selections is a logical OR of all values. | If the **Suggestion field** is “environment,” then you can set the variable to any of the environments available in the graph’s data. 
Key | Any of the search keys for the graph’s underlying data. | With a “Key” suggestion, the variable’s **Default value** is a search key. When you use the variable in a graph, you set the value of the variable using a select with all search keys. | If the **Suggestion type** is “Key,” you can use the variable in function, grouping, or bucketing rules. For instance, you could create multiple graphs in a dashboard that are grouped by a parameterized value. 
None | Any: the variable’s input is free text. | With a “None” suggestion, the variable’s **Default value** can be any string. When you use the variable in a graph, you set the value of the variable by entering any string. | If the **Suggestion type** is “None,” this is a freeform variable. You can use it for any function, grouping, or bucketing rules, and there are no restrictions on what value it can hold. 
![The "Variables" dialog, with a new variable filled in.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/65d198e1721e63bac6a727bb5fbb36b75eb45595d96844e5c2b701442ecdad37/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/o11y-dashboard-example-variable.png)
The "Variables" dialog, with a new variable filled in.
 5. Click **Save**.
 6. In any of the filter, function, grouping, or bucketing rules components of the graph editor, reference your variable by entering a dollar (`$`) followed by the variable’s **Name** , for example, `$environment` or `$emailAddress`.
## View graph details
For each graph, you can always take a closer look at the underlying data. Here’s how:
 1. Click **Dashboards** in the left sidenav.
 2. Find the dashboard you want to update and click its name.
 3. Find the graph you want to examine and hover over its graphed data. A tooltip of the current datapoints appears.
 4. Click to freeze the tooltip and show links to the details for each data point:
![A graph on a dashboard. The tooltip displays information on the current datapoints, and the details links are called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/c870bb2f20d1f383cd5d76f5f31bb8b45c81adbb7f897678302dcafceff40156/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/o11y-dashboard-view-details.png)
