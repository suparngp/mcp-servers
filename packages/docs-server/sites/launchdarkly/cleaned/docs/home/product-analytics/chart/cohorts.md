## Overview
This topic explains how to use the product analytics **Cohorts** tab, and what information that tab contains. A cohort is a group of users you create to track their activity in different parts of your product.
You can also use this tab to create new cohorts.
## The Cohorts tab
The **Cohorts** tab is displayed with multiple columns. You can search by typing in the box to find a specific cohort.
 * Cohort name: Shows the name and description of a cohort.
 * Last modified: Shows how recently the contents of this cohort changed.
 * Created by: Shows who from your LaunchDarkly account created this cohort.
Click the **three-dot** overflow menu to perform actions on a specific cohort:
 * **Create chart with cohort** : Shows the cohort on a graph.
 * **Share link to cohort** : Copies a link to that cohort to your clipboard.
 * **Download cohort as CSV** : Exports the cohort as a CSV and downloads it to your device.
 * **Edit cohort** : Lets you change the cohort.
 * **Duplicate cohort** : Creates a new cohort with the same settings as the cohort you clicked.
 * **Archive cohort** : Removes cohort from the tab and stores its information and settings.
## Create a cohort
To create a new cohort, you can either upload a CSV file or manually add users.
To create a cohort manually:
 1. Navigate to the **Cohorts** tab and click **New cohort**. The “New cohort” menu opens.
 2. Choose **Define my own**. The “Create cohort” page opens.
 3. Give the cohort a human-readable **Name**.
 4. Optionally, add a description.
 5. In the “Filters” section, click **Add filter group**.
 6. Search to find the event, user attribute, or existing cohort you wish to add to the new cohort. You can add multiple filters, and toggle between `and` or `or` operators to specify how to combine them.
 7. Click **Save**. The new cohort appears in the **Cohorts** tab. If you can’t find it, search for its name in the search box.
To create a cohort with a CSV:
 1. Navigate to the **Cohorts** tab and click **New cohort**. The “New cohort” menu opens.
 2. Choose **Upload a CSV**. The “Import cohort from CSV” page opens.
 3. Give the cohort a human-readable **Name**.
 4. Optionally, add a description.
 5. Click to upload or drag a CSV file into the upload area.
 6. Click **Upload**. The new cohort appears in the **Cohorts** tab. If you can’t find it, search for its name in the search box.
