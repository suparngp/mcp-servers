  "description": "This topic explains how to target a segment in a flag rule. If you have many flags that need to target the same group of users or other contexts, we recommend that you [create a single segment](/docs/home/flags/segments-create) for your flags to target. This lets you manage targeting for that group in one place instead of recreating identical rules in each flag."
