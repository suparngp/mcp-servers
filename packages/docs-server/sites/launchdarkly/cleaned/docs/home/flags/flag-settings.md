## Overview
This topic explains how to edit a feature flag’s environment-specific and project-wide settings.
## Environment-specific flag settings
To view a flag’s environment-specific settings:
 1. Navigate to the **Flags** list and open the flag you wish to view settings for.
 2. Click the **three-dot** overflow menu for the environment you want.
![The environment overflow menu.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/e03f37840baff486344b755ece50f181bbc77710c22f6297b195efbdb402d613/assets/images/auto/environment-overflow-menu-flag.auto.png)
The environment overflow menu.
 1. Select **Configuration in environment**. The “Environment configuration” screen appears.
From the environment configuration screen, you can update the flag’s Data Export settings or its triggers.
### Data Export
If you use Data Export, by default LaunchDarkly summarizes flag evaluation events to minimize data use, and limits events transmission to 100 MBps. If you want to send more detailed information instead, you can enable sending detailed events to Data Export destinations. You can adjust this setting for each environment in the project.
To learn more, read [Data Export](/docs/integrations/data-export).
### Triggers
Flag triggers let you make changes to flag targeting remotely from a third-party application, such as an application performance monitoring (APM) tool. You can use triggers to turn flag targeting on or off. You can enable flag triggers for each environment in the project.
To learn more, read [Flag triggers](/docs/home/releases/triggers).
### Additional environment-specific settings
Some additional environment-specific settings appear in a flag’s right sidebar. This table describes all of the flag settings that apply to a specific environment, and where they appear:
Flag setting | Description 
---|--- 
[Experiments](/docs/home/experimentation) | Experiments being conducted on the flag in this environment. Experiments appear in the flag’s right sidebar. 
[Multi-armed bandits](/docs/home/multi-armed-bandits) | Multi-armed bandits that include the flag in this environment. Multi-armed bandits appear in the flag’s right sidebar. 
[Pending changes](/docs/home/releases/scheduled-changes) | Any scheduled changes for the flag in this environment. Pending changes appear in the flag’s right sidebar. 
[Data Export](/docs/integrations/data-export#export-flag-event-data) | Whether to include this flag in your Data Export files. Data Export settings appear on the flag’s “Environment configuration” page. 
[Flag triggers](/docs/home/releases/triggers-create) | The ability to make flag changes from third-party apps. Flag triggers appear on the flag’s “Environment configuration” page. 
## Flag settings for all environments
To view a flag’s settings for all environments within the project, navigate to the **Flags** list and open the flag you wish to view. The settings for all environments appear in the right sidebar. You can make changes to the flag’s settings in the right sidebar by clicking the **pencil** icon next to the setting you want to update.
![Settings in the right sidebar of a flag.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/11ec3e1d135654f79f3d826e300c45dca5d2d7ce89326c9db37e3c93dfefa85e/assets/images/auto/flag-right-sidebar.auto.png)
Settings in the right sidebar of a flag.
Changes you make to an individual flag’s settings do not apply to other flags, even if they share the same template as the flag you modify. To learn more, read [Flag templates](/docs/home/flags/templates).
This table describes flag settings that apply to all environments. Unless otherwise noted, these settings appear in a flag’s right sidebar:
Flag setting | Description 
---|--- 
Name | The name of the flag. Appears at the top of the flag details page. 
Description | The description of the flag. 
Key | The key of the flag. 
Maintainer | The member designated as responsible for upkeep of the flag. 
[Views](/docs/home/account/views) | Any views the flag is included in. 
[Tags](/docs/home/account/tags) | Any tags assigned to the flag. 
[Variations](/docs/home/flags/variations) | The variations of the flag. Appears in the flag’s right sidebar and its **Variations** tab. 
[Release pipelines](/docs/home/releases/release-pipelines) | Any release pipelines the flag is included in. 
[Code references](/docs/home/flags/code-references) | Code repositories that reference the flag. 
[Links](/docs/home/flags/links) | Links to the flag from other applications. 
Client-side SDK availability | Whether your client-side SDKs can evaluate this flag. 
Mobile SDK availability | Whether your mobile SDKs can evaluate this flag. 
Permanent or temporary flag | Whether you consider this flag permanent or temporary.
