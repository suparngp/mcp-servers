## Overview
This topic explains how to edit, test, and delete segments.
## Update segment details
To update a segment’s name, description, or tags:
 1. Navigate to the segment detail page for the segment you want to update.
 2. Click the **gear** icon to open the segment’s settings page.
 3. Edit the **Name** , **Description** , and **Tags** for each segment.
 4. Click **Save**.
## Update segment targeting
To update a segment’s targeting:
 1. Navigate to the segment detail page for the segment you want to update.
 2. Update the segment’s targeting based on the kind of segment:
 * For rule-based segments, add, remove, or edit the segment’s targeting rules. To learn more, read [Rule-based segments](/docs/home/flags/rule-based-segments).
 * For list-based segments, add or remove individual targets or upload a new CSV to overwrite or merge with the existing targets. To learn more, read [List-based segments](/docs/home/flags/list-based-segments).
 * For synced segments, you cannot change segment targeting within LaunchDarkly. Instead, edit the segment in the source application. To learn more, read [Segments synced from external tools](/docs/home/flags/synced-segments).
## Test segment targeting
You can use the test run feature to test a segment’s targeting rules to find out whether or not a particular context will be included in the segment. Testing segment targeting helps ensure that contexts are included or excluded from segments as you expect.
To test a segment’s targeting:
 1. From the **Segments** list, open the segment you want to test.
 2. Make any needed changes to the segment rules and save your changes.
 3. Click the **fingerprint** test run icon. The “Test run a context” section appears.
 4. In the contexts field, search for and select the context you want to preview.
![The "Test run a context" section, populated with an example context kind and key.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/9a670a1f4d2fe45d6bccc023b7ba1fe59ae4adbce362435b881b69647620cffe/assets/images/auto/test-rules-segment.auto.png)
The "Test run a context" section, populated with an example context kind and key.
The “Test run a context” section populates with whether or not the context is included in the segment.
## Delete segments
To delete a segment:
 1. Navigate to the segment detail page for the segment you want to update.
 2. Click the **gear** icon to open the segment’s settings page.
 3. Click **Delete this segment**.
 4. In the “Delete segment?” dialog, click **Delete**.
You cannot delete a segment if one or more flags is using it.
