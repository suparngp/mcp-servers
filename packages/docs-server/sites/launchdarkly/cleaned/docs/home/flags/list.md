## Overview
This topic explains how to use the **Flags** list, which shows your feature flags and gives you options to create, modify, and manage them.
All of your feature flags within a project appear on the **Flags** list. Creating a new flag adds it to the list and all environments within your project, and archiving a feature flag removes it from the list and all environments within your project.
Here is an image of the feature **Flags** list:
![The Flags list.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/c0fb4e456fce003148cc9aeda03d1dfd512cc295eb242afc0d214fcc2cf116c3/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/flags-list.png)
The Flags list.
The **Flags** list shows the following information about each flag for each environment:
 * How many times the flag has been evaluated.
 * Whether the flag is **On** or **Off**.
 * Whether the flag is included in a release pipeline, indicated by a “shipped” icon. To learn more, read [Release pipelines](/docs/home/releases/release-pipelines).
 * Whether the flag is included in a guarded rollout, indicated by a “shield” icon. To learn more, read [Guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts).
 * A bar showing the proportion of contexts that have been served each variation. For boolean flags, the true (“available” or “enabled”) variation is blue and the false (“unavailable” or “disabled”) variation is yellow.
Hover over the information for a flag to view more details about its variations, evaluations, and any guarded rollouts or release pipelines the flag is included in.
![](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/launchdarkly/openapi-logo.svg)
You can also use the REST API: [List feature flags](/docs/api/feature-flags/get-feature-flags)
To learn how to create a new flag, read [Create a feature flag](/docs/home/flags/new#create-a-feature-flag). To learn how to archive a flag, read [Archive flags](/docs/home/flags/archive).
## View feature flags
Use the search bar to find a flag by name, key, or description. By default, the most recently created flags appear first.
You can view your flags as a list, or in the project’s release pipeline. To view flags in the project’s release pipeline, click **Release assistant** in the left sidenav. To learn more, read [Release pipelines](/docs/home/releases/release-pipelines).
## Filter feature flags
You can filter the list of flags to view only flags that share a particular attribute.
### Project-level filters
Some flag attributes, such as tag or SDK availability, are the same across all environments in your project. To filter your flags based on project-wide attributes, use the **Filters** menu at the top of the **Flags** list:
![The filter menu for project-wide flag attributes.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/0b45b35d7d367b5cc1bf779de97330c853a444564365a2ce993de67895780cee/assets/images/auto/flags-list-filter-general.auto.png)
The filter menu for project-wide flag attributes.
Within a project, you can filter by:
 * Tags
 * Maintainer
 * Lifecycle: live, ready for code removal, ready to archive, archived, deprecated
 * Type: temporary or permanent
 * Has connections: whether or not the flag has code references
 * Targeted context kind
 * Evaluated context kind
 * Evaluated application
 * SDK availability
 * Creation date
To filter your flags at the project level:
 1. Click **Filters**.
 2. Choose an attribute for a filtering option. The **Flags** list automatically updates.
 3. (Optional) Click **Filters** again and choose an additional attribute. Repeat as many times as needed.
![Two filters applied to the Flags list.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/2c252224e011c49060f9cb26010ac4837a033ee6b2a347d6b303efc27de4f438/assets/images/auto/flags-list-filter.auto.png)
Two filters applied to the Flags list.
### Environment-level filters
Other flag attributes, such as targeting state or status, are different for each environment. To filter your flags based on environment-specific attributes, use the **filter** icon in any of your [open environments](/docs/home/account/environment#open-environments). Hover your cursor over the environment name and select the **filter** icon to access all the available filters.
![The filter menu for environment-specific flag attributes.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/885b09c041fddea35a1559fde7998f9043341330e4d055193e4eda3b0694ebee/assets/images/auto/flags-list-filter-env-specific.auto.png)
The filter menu for environment-specific flag attributes.
Within an environment, you can filter by:
 * Last evaluated
 * Flags you follow
 * Targeting state: off or on
 * Whether or not it is using Data Export
 * Whether or not it is used in an experiment
 * Status: new, active, launched, or inactive
 * Guarded rollout status
Flag statuses are denoted on the **Flags** list with different icons depending on their status. To learn more, read [Flag statuses and lifecycle stages](/docs/home/flags/flag-status).
To filter your flags at the environment level:
 1. Click the **filter** icon at the top of the environment’s flag list.
 2. Choose an attribute for a filtering option. The **Flags** list for that environment automatically updates.
 3. (Optional) Click the **filter** icon again and choose an additional attribute. Repeat as many times as needed.
Your **Flags** list now displays only the flags that match the filters you specified.
##### Filtering by maintainer includes teams
If you filter flags by maintainer, you can choose to view flags maintained by an individual member or by a team.
### Remove filters
To clear project-level filters, click **Filters** , then click **Clear**.
To clear environment-level filters, click the **filter** icon at the top of the environment’s flag list, then click **Clear**.
### Save shortcuts to filtered Flags lists
You can create shortcuts to filtered **Flags** lists, and save them in the left sidenav to return to at any time.
When you create a shortcut, it is only visible to you. To group flags within a project and have that grouping be visible for everyone in your account, we recommend using [views](/docs/home/account/views).
To create a shortcut to a filtered **Flags** list:
 1. Navigate to the **Flags** list.
 2. Add your desired environments to the **Flags** list following the instructions in [Open environments](/docs/home/account/environment#open-environments).
 3. Add any flag filters you need such as tags, maintainers, or flag statuses, following the instructions in [Filter feature flags](/docs/home/flags/list#filter-feature-flags).
 4. Click the **bolt** icon above the **Flags** list to create a shortcut:
![The Flags list with the bolt icon called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/dcff58fbeff8fd40ebe25538af6b8817d11ae2858c7c4a8f07f7294c9fb7969d/assets/images/auto/list-shortcut-callout.auto.png)
The Flags list with the bolt icon called out.
 1. Add a **Name** for your shortcut.
 2. (Optional) Choose an **Icon** to represent your shortcut in the left sidenav.
 3. Click **Save**.
Your shortcut appears in the left sidenav.
![A list of shortcuts in the left sidenav.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/f42b84c4d73287885cd06d69dda7c02ae9b88332f68a53b880dededb0fbbb374/assets/images/auto/shortcuts.auto.png)
A list of shortcuts in the left sidenav.
## Sort feature flags
You can sort the list of visible flags by creation date, by name, or by last modified date. To sort the **Flags** list, click **Sort** and choose a sorting option:
![The "Sort" option on the Flags list.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/96753712cc11082190bd63bfc91957122618e514efe7e853c61e0590720a3172/assets/images/auto/flags-list-sort.auto.png)
The "Sort" option on the Flags list.
## Edit list columns
Using the **Display** menu, you can display or hide the following flag properties from the **Flags** list:
 * Key
 * Description
 * Maintainer
 * Views
 * Tags
 * Created date
 * Archive checks
When the archive checks are selected, the list indicates whether a flag is ready for code removal or is ready to archive. To learn more, read [Flag statuses and lifecycle stages](/docs/home/flags/flag-status).
You can also check the **Use key instead of name** option in the **Display** menu to show flag keys instead of flag names in the **Flags** list:
![The "Display" option on the Flags list.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/b3009288baf66fc0481508d55095a5384b0c6d20e338f912b3e311f1d8fdf3ca/assets/images/auto/flags-list-display.auto.png)
The "Display" option on the Flags list.
## Limit to views
Using the **View** menu, you can show only flags that are linked to selected [views](/docs/home/account/views). Views are resources to logically group flags within a project. For example, you can create “frontend” and “backend” views to organize flags within your project, and separate access to flags in those views.
## Follow flags
You can follow a flag to receive an email notification, and, if applicable, a notification in the LaunchDarkly Slack app, when someone makes a targeting change to that flag. Notifications are environment-specific, so you must follow a flag in each environment you want notifications for.
If you have the LaunchDarkly Slack app installed, you will automatically receive notifications in Slack about any changes to flags you have followed. To learn more about the Slack app, read [Slack](/docs/integrations/slack).
To follow a flag:
 1. From the **Flags** list, click on the name of the flag you want to follow. The flag’s **Targeting** tab opens.
 2. Click on the name of the environment you want to follow the flag in.
 * If the environment you want is not displayed, click the **+** to display the list of environments, and select the environment you want.
![The environment selection menu.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/34b4f0b3517652a1d52892a144f582c4acfeb5b49bfaf2ffee688fca284f3ce6/assets/images/auto/environment-selection.auto.png)
The environment selection menu.
 3. Click on the **Follow flag** icon.
![The "follow flag" icon called out on the flag's right sidebar.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/c35c0de6f1d85f650f924f3848c67cabcf2cf1a6a958ea7d93bdddf710326a79/assets/images/auto/follow-flag-icon-callout.auto.png)
The "follow flag" icon called out on the flag's right sidebar.
![](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/launchdarkly/openapi-logo.svg)
You can also use the REST API: [Add a member as a follower of a flag](/api/follow-flags/put-flag-followers), [Remove a member as a follower of a flag](/api/follow-flags/delete-flag-followers)
### Save shortcuts to flag Targeting tabs
You can create shortcuts to a specific environment on a flag’s **Targeting** tab. This allows you to return to that flag’s environment-specific **Targeting** tab from a shortcut in the left sidenav.
To create a shortcut to a flag’s **Targeting** tab:
 1. From the **Flags** list, open a flag’s **Targeting** tab.
 2. Open your desired environment following the instructions in [Open environments](/docs/home/account/environment#open-environments).
 3. Click the **bolt** icon in the right sidebar to create a shortcut.
 4. Add a **Name** for your shortcut.
 5. (Optional) Choose an **Icon** to represent your shortcut in the left sidenav.
 6. Click **Save**.
Your shortcut appears in the left sidenav.
