  "description": "This topic explains how to set the default rule for a flag. LaunchDarkly defines a final default rule, sometimes called the “fallthrough” rule, for any contexts that don’t match any of the previous targeting rules on the flag. The default rule can be a single variation, a [guarded rollout](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts), a [progressive rollout](/docs/home/releases/progressive-rollouts), or a [percentage rollout](/docs/home/releases/percentage-rollouts)."
