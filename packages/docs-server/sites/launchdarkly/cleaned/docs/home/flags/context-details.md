## Overview
This topic explains what the context details page is. The context details page gives you a detailed view of a context and lets you customize its experience from one screen.
To open the details page for a context, click on the context name from the **Contexts** list.
This is an example of a [multi-context](/docs/home/flags/multi-contexts) details page:
![The details page for a multi-context.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/cabcd9936feae32d1b47ee7f0c8e9ca50f3b941fe7c6a416a4884b2c1c4586e4/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/context-details-multi-context.png)
The details page for a multi-context.
## Attributes
The “Attributes” section displays all of the context attributes associated with the selected context instance version. A context instance version is a context instance that’s recorded from a unique source application or LaunchDarkly SDK. It includes only the context attributes you provide in the evaluation call. To learn more, read [Context instances](/docs/home/flags/context-instances).
This illustration shows a flag evaluating two instance versions of the same context:
![Two instance versions of the same context.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/0736598633b74c5e9be06e3d001af3637ffe9aaa0a2b6481c8b6f5615898c497/assets/images/__not_from_LD_app_UI/context-instance-versions.png)
Two instance versions of the same context.
To view attributes from a different context instance version, choose a different version from the “From source” menu:
![The "From source" menu with two context instance versions displayed.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/0e7a01bd70cf07eac1ef27aa968482f29317742fcc6b5b8a00ab9cdd08fd0feb/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/context-details-instance-menu.png)
The "From source" menu with two context instance versions displayed.
To learn more, read [Context attributes](/docs/home/flags/context-attributes).
![](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/launchdarkly/openapi-logo.svg)
You can also use the REST API: [Get context attribute names](/docs/api/contexts/get-context-attribute-names), [Get context attribute values](/docs/api/contexts/get-context-attribute-values)
## Segments
The “Segments” section lists any segments the context is a part of. Click on the segment name to open the segment’s details page. To learn more, read [Segments](/docs/home/flags/segments).
## Instances
The “Instances” section lists the instances in which the context has appeared, and when LaunchDarkly last encountered each instance:
![The "Instances" section with two instances.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/ea8bc5a5331b07a98a6c47c215d50ecfc1cbd4b9104aed25f5aa6761cf648e9c/assets/images/auto/context-details-instances.auto.png)
The "Instances" section with two instances.
If a context has an instance count higher than one, that means it is part of a multi-context.
Click on an individual instance name to open the instance details page. The instance details page lists the context kinds, attributes, segments, and expected flag variations for that particular context instance. To learn more, read [Context instances](/docs/home/flags/context-instances).
![](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/launchdarkly/openapi-logo.svg)
You can also use the REST API: [Get context instances](/docs/api/contexts/get-context-instances)
### Delete context instances
To delete a context instance:
 1. From the **Contexts** list, click on the name of the context with an instance you want to delete. The context details page opens.
 2. In the “Instances” section, click on an instance. The instance details page opens.
 3. Click **Delete** :
![A context instance detail page with the "Delete" button called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/74c2a3cbee21aaecb52b82e98039498415f22a1d59aed917e866aff4f1e62e55/assets/images/auto/context-details-instances-delete-callout.auto.png)
A context instance detail page with the "Delete" button called out.
Deleting a context instance deletes all versions of that instance. Deleting context instances from the **Contexts** list does not decrease your [account usage](/docs/home/account/metrics).
![](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/launchdarkly/openapi-logo.svg)
You can also use the REST API: [Delete context instances](/docs/api/contexts/delete-context-instances)
## Expected variations
The “Expected variations” section lists the variation you can expect that context instance to receive for each flag or AI Config within your current project and environment.
![The "Expected variations" on the details page for a context.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/ea4f766c1fff171dcc5158d684b52ecba4277c68e280f8de2547d59afb55a91b/assets/images/auto/context-details-expected-variations.auto.png)
The "Expected variations" on the details page for a context.
For each flag, you can use your SDK’s flag evaluation reason feature to get more information about the flag variations LaunchDarkly serves.
![](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/launchdarkly/terminal.svg)
Try it in your SDK: [Flag evaluation reasons](/docs/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons)
### Modify variations for a context
You can modify the variation a context receives for a feature flag or an AI Config. To do this:
 1. Find the “Entity name” you want to modify in the “Expected variations” section.
 2. Select a new variation from the **Variation** menu next to the flag:
![The "Expected flag variations" section with a variation called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/7761940d310d267e0dcbd92d438e4de647572fadcb75bcace086b51d28277a0b/assets/images/auto/context-details-targeting-callout.auto.png)
The "Expected variations" section with a variation called out.
 1. (Optional) To remove individual targeting, either:
 * change to the variation from the **Variation** dropdown, or
 * click the “Evaluation reason” link to remove the individual target from the flag’s **Targeting** tab.
 1. Click **Save changes**.
##### Targeting changes are only available for individual contexts.
You cannot make targeting changes to context instances with multiple contexts. That option is not available on the instance details page with multiple contexts.
