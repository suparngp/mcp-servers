## Overview
This topic explains how to enable and disable flags in the LaunchDarkly platform.
##### The flag toggle button is a circuit breaker for any feature
The flag button lets you turn off a feature that’s misbehaving without needing to touch any code or re-deploy your application. Wrap the entire feature in a feature flag to control or revoke its rollout seamlessly.
## Turn on flags
When you create a new flag, it is turned **Off** by default. You can turn the flag **On** by clicking the flag toggle button on the flag’s **Targeting** tab.
To turn on a flag:
 1. From the **Flags** list, click on the name of the flag you want to turn on. The flag’s **Targeting** tab opens.
 2. Click on the tab for the environment you want to turn on the flag for.
 * If the tab for the environment is not displayed, click the **+** to display the list of environments, and select the environment you want:
![The environment selection menu.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/34b4f0b3517652a1d52892a144f582c4acfeb5b49bfaf2ffee688fca284f3ce6/assets/images/auto/environment-selection.auto.png)
The environment selection menu.
 3. Click the flag toggle. The toggle turns green and displays the word **On**.

The flag toggle on the targeting tab.
 4. Click **Review and save**.
To learn more about creating flags, read [Creating new flags](/docs/home/flags/new).
## Turn off flags
When you turn a flag to **Off** , you disable the targeting rules for that flag. Instead of serving an active variation, you serve the off variation.
On the flag’s **Targeting** tab, you can set an off variation for both boolean and multivariate flags. Boolean feature flags default to `false` when the feature flag is **Off**.
To turn a flag **Off** :
 1. From the **Flags** list, click on the name of the flag you want to turn on. The flag’s **Targeting** tab opens.
 2. Click on the tab for the environment you want to turn off the flag for.
 * If the tab for the environment is not displayed, click the **+** to display the list of environments, and select the environment you want:
![The environment selection menu.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/34b4f0b3517652a1d52892a144f582c4acfeb5b49bfaf2ffee688fca284f3ce6/assets/images/auto/environment-selection.auto.png)
The environment selection menu.
 3. Set the toggle to **Off**. The variation the flag will serve when you save your changes appears:
![The "Off" value for a flag.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/dc9a2b0e4c56454b626cba4376fc0372e9b0a265d4686ac723f4834262823d48/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/flag-off-default-value-new.png)
The "Off" value for a flag.
 4. Click **Review and save**.
If you don’t specify an explicit default off variation, LaunchDarkly serves the fallback value for the flag. You can specify the fallback value in your code’s variation calls. View the fallback value in the flag’s **Targeting** tab.
##### Planning feature flags for future events
You can schedule a flag for a particular date using scheduled flag changes, or you can use targeting rules to control what it affects and when. For example, you can serve `false` to deprecate a feature after a date of your choosing, or you can target a specific context or segment to be removed from the flag’s targeting settings. To learn more, read [Target with flags](/docs/home/flags/target).
## Watch for changes in your application
When you turn a flag on and off, you should immediately see the corresponding changes in your application. You can try this yourself by following the in-app [Quickstart](/docs/home/getting-started) or running `ldcli setup` in the [LaunchDarkly CLI](/docs/home/getting-started/ldcli).
If you do not see changes in your application when you turn the flag on and off, try checking the following:
 * **Does your SDK successfully initialize?** Look in your application logs for a message that says `SDK successfully initialized`. If you find `SDK failed to initialize` instead, check your SDK credentials. You may be using an invalid SDK key, mobile key, or client-side ID.
 * **Does your application use a valid feature flag key and SDK credential?** If you are using the in-app [Quickstart](/docs/home/getting-started) or running `ldcli setup` in the [LaunchDarkly CLI](/docs/home/getting-started/ldcli), the flag key and SDK key, mobile key, or client-side ID for your environment are automatically inserted into the sample code that you are prompted to copy. If you are working directly from one of our [Sample applications](/docs/sdk/concepts/sample-applications), you will need to do this manually. Review the README file in the sample application repository for details on where to update your flag key and SDK credential.
 * **Does your organization’s network close long-lived streaming connections?** You will not see flag updates if you are no longer connected to LaunchDarkly. Try restarting your application to re-open the connection. If this solves the problem, work with your organization to allow longer-lived streaming connections.
 * **Does your organization’s network use an https proxy?** If all of your network traffic is going through a proxy, your application may take longer to update when you turn flags on and off.
 * **Does your organization’s network require additional authorization to allow outbound connections?** For example, some organizations require [bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) for outbound traffic. You may need to update your application code to include this authorization.
