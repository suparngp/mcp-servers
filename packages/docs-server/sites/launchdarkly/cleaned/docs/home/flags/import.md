## Overview
This topic explains how to import flags from other feature management tools into LaunchDarkly. You can import flags from Split.io or Unleash.
When you import flags from another system, the following properties are imported:
 * Name, key, and description
 * Variations
 * Default rule, for when targeting is On and contexts don’t match any targeting rules
 * Default off variation, for when targeting is Off
 * Tags
Other flag properties for imported flags are set based on your [settings for all environments](/docs/home/flags/flag-settings).
If any flags in the other system have the same flag key as an existing flag in LaunchDarkly, those flags are skipped. They are not imported to LaunchDarkly.
The imported flags are toggled off in all environments in LaunchDarkly, regardless of their state in the other system.
##### Targeting rules are not imported
When you import flags from another system, the flag prerequisites, individual targets, and targeting rules are not imported. You’ll need to recreate these in LaunchDarkly for each environment. To learn how, read [Target with flags](/docs/home/flags/target).
## Import flags
You can import flags, and monitor each import, from the **Integrations** page in LaunchDarkly. After the import is complete, you can view the imported flags on the **Flags** list.
### Configure flag import
To import flags:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Integrations** and search for “Import.”
 3. Find the integration for the system from which you are importing flags, for example, the “Split” integration or the “Unleash” integration.
 4. Click **Add integration**. A “Create configuration” panel appears.
 5. (Optional) Enter a **Name** for this configuration. For example, you might include which systems or projects you are importing from.
 6. Select the **Project** to import flags into.
 * You cannot edit this part of the configuration after creation. To import flags into a different project later, create a new flag import configuration.
 1. Enter identifying information for the flags you want to import.
###### Expand for Split
 * Enter a **Split API Key** that has read permissions to your Split workspace.
 * Enter your **Split Workspace ID**.
 * Enter your **Split Environment ID**.
 * (Optional) Enter a **Split Tag**. Only flags with this tag will be imported to LaunchDarkly.
###### Expand for Unleash
 * Enter the **Unleash Base URL** used to connect to your Unleash instance.
 * Enter an **Unleash SDK Key** that has read permissions to your Unleash environment.
 * Enter your **Unleash Project ID**.
 * Enter your **Unleash Environment ID**.
 * (Optional) Enter an **Unleash Tag**. Only flags with this tag will be imported to LaunchDarkly.
 1. Enter a **LaunchDarkly API Key** that has create flag permissions in this LaunchDarkly project. To learn more, read [Creating API access tokens](/docs/home/account/api-create).
 2. (Optional) Enter a **LaunchDarkly Tag**. All flags imported to LaunchDarkly using this configuration will have this tag, which defaults to `imported-from-<external tool>`. All imported flags will also retain any tags they have in the source system.
 3. Confirm or update the **LaunchDarkly Maintainer**.
 4. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
 5. Click **Save configuration**.
 6. The import process for your flags begins immediately.
### View import status
To view the status of your flag import:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Integrations** and search for “Import.”
 3. Find the integration for the system from which you are importing flags, for example, the “Split” integration or the “Unleash” integration.
From here, you can review the configuration information for this import. This includes the following information:
 * “Configuration name” column with the configuration name and project.
 * “State” column with information on the import progress:
 * A state of “completed” means that all flags selected in this configuration have been imported to LaunchDarkly.
 * Click **See error** to view details of any errors for “partial” or “failed” imports. You can also find this information by clicking the **overflow** menu and choosing “View error log.” If you would like help addressing an error, [start a Support ticket](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
 * “Last successful import” column with a timestamp of when the most recent full or partial import occurred.

### Trigger import
To re-import flags using an existing configuration:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Integrations** and search for “Import.”
 3. Find the integration for the system from which you are importing flags, for example, the “Split” integration or the “Unleash” integration.
 4. Click the **expand** icon to view the list of flag import configurations. Locate the flag import you want to re-run.
 5. Click the **pencil** icon. The Edit Split configuration panel appears.
 6. Click **Trigger import**.
## View flags
To view your imported flags, navigate to the **Flags** list. Optionally, [filter](/docs/home/flags/list#filter-feature-flags) the list based on the LaunchDarkly tag you specified during the import configuration.
Imported flags are toggled off in all environments in LaunchDarkly, regardless of their state in the other system. Additionally, flag prerequisites, individual targets, and targeting rules are not imported. You’ll need to recreate these in LaunchDarkly for each environment.
