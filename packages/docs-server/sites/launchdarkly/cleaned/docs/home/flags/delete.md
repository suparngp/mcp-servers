## Overview
This topic explains how to permanently delete flags that are already archived.
Deleting a flag removes it from all environments and deletes its targeting rules. If you are not sure whether to remove a flag, archive it instead. To learn more, read [Archiving flags](/docs/home/flags/archive).
## Delete archived flags
After you archive a flag, you can delete it when you no longer need it.
When you delete a flag, LaunchDarkly removes its targeting rules. If the flag is requested again, the fallback value defined in code is returned for all contexts. Before you delete a flag, remove any references to it from your application code.
##### Deleted flags are gone forever
You cannot restore a deleted flag. Make sure your team no longer needs the flag before you delete it.
Many teams archive flags first, then delete them after cleanup is complete. Archiving keeps a flag available for reference, while deleting permanently removes it from LaunchDarkly and the REST API.
To delete an archived flag:
 1. Navigate to the **Flags** list.
 2. Click **Filters**. In the “Lifecycle” section, click **Archived**. The archived flags list appears.
 3. Click a flag name to open the flag you wish to delete.
 4. Click the **three-dot** overflow menu in the right sidebar.
 5. Select **Delete**. The “Delete this flag?” dialog appears.
 6. Enter the flag’s name or key in the **Confirm** field.
 7. Click **Delete**.
The flag is permanently deleted.
