  "description": "This topic includes information about multi-contexts. Contexts are people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Multi-contexts are combinations of several context kinds into one context. Multi-contexts allow your feature flags to target entities based on data from multiple contexts. For multi-contexts, the context `kind` is set to `multi`."
