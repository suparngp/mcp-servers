## Overview
This topic explains how to choose and ship a winning variation for a completed Bayesian experiment.
To learn about winning variations in frequentist experiments, read [Frequentist experiment results](/docs/home/experimentation/frequentist-results).
For experiments using Bayesian statistics, the winning variation is the variation with the highest [probability to be best](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#probability-to-be-best) that exceeds the Bayesian [threshold](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#threshold) you set when you created the experiment.
If a Bayesian experiment has collected enough data to determine a winning variation, and the winning variation is not the control, then the winning variation is highlighted in green in its results chart.
If all treatment variations have a significantly low probability of beating the control, then the control is considered the winning variation. To learn more, read [Decision making with Bayesian statistics](/docs/home/experimentation/bayesian).
## Ship the winning variation
To stop an experiment and ship the winning variation:
 1. Navigate to the experiment’s **Results** tab.
 2. Click **Stop**. The “Ship” menu appears.
 3. Select the winning variation to ship to all contexts that match the flag’s targeting rule. A “Stop experiment” dialog appears.
 4. Enter a **Reason for stopping**.
 5. Click **Stop experiment**.
Bayesian experiments also display a **Ship it** button if the experiment has enough data to determine a winning variation, and that winning variation is not the control. You can use this option to stop the experiment and ship the winning variation.
