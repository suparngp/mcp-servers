## Overview
This topic explains how to complete the quickstart for LaunchDarkly’s Experimentation product.
Follow the instructions below to complete the Experimentation quickstart and create your first experiment.
##### Try the LaunchDarkly sandbox
You can also use the [LaunchDarkly demo sandbox](https://demo.app.launchdarkly.com/).
## Important concepts
As you progress through the Experimentation quickstart, you may encounter terminology that’s new to you. Here’s a brief explanation of what some of these terms mean. If you want to go into more detail about anything in this section, read [Experimentation and metric events](/docs/home/experimentation/events).
### Events and metrics
Two distinct, interconnected resources in LaunchDarkly are “events” and “metrics.”
 * **Events** are raw data that represent specific actions, such as a button click or a page view. They are instrumented in code, and used to create metrics.
 * **Metrics** define how event data should be aggregated and interpreted so you can measure the effect of a change. They are created in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI).
For example, an event can log each time a user clicks “Buy,” while the metric measures the average conversion rate of this action for your website’s visitors.
## Best practices for identifying useful data when designing experiments
Start by identifying actions relevant to most experiments, such as conversion rate or page load time, and create events representing those in LaunchDarkly. As you build experiments, gradually add additional specific events and corresponding metrics.
As you add events to LaunchDarkly, here are some tools you can use:
 * The [event explorer](/docs/home/metrics/view-incoming-events) lists the events your SDKs are sending to LaunchDarkly. Use it to view what events you’re already sending from your app, and to confirm that new events are arriving as expected.
 * You can use events from external warehouses, such as Snowflake. This lets you run [warehouse native experiments](/docs/home/warehouse-native).
When you define metrics in LaunchDarkly, here some of the things to keep in mind:
 * Consider the unit you’re using. To use a given metric in an experiment, the metric’s unit needs to be the same as the experiment’s [randomization unit](/docs/home/experimentation/randomization). If you’re familiar with other aspects of LaunchDarkly, it will help you to know that the experiment’s unit is synonymous with its context kind. The most common context kind and randomization unit is `user`.
 * You can often derive additional helpful metrics from a single conversion event. Depending on the experiment’s hypothesis, it might be helpful to measure the event occurrence (the portion of users who converted at least once), the event count (the average number of conversion events per user), or the average value associated with the given conversion event.
## Using the quickstart
The quickstart takes you through the core actions to create an experiment in a controlled, abbreviated workflow. You will choose and initialize a LaunchDarkly SDK, create a flag and metrics, and instrument events to monitor when your experiment gets interaction. These are the core steps to begin an experiment.
Here’s how to begin the Experimentation quickstart.
 1. Log in to LaunchDarkly.
 2. In the lower left corner, click the **question mark** icon. A menu appears.
 3. In the “Developer” section, choose **Quickstart**. The quickstart appears.
 4. Click **Experiments** to expand the experimentation quickstart steps.
## Step 1: Connect your app
To begin, you must install a LaunchDarkly SDK locally. Here’s how:
 1. Click to expand **Step 1: Connect your app**.
 2. Choose an SDK from the dropdown menu. Its installation instructions appear.
 3. Install the SDK in your app:
Java (XML)Java (Gradle)JavaScript (yarn)JavaScript (npm).NET (client) (C#)Node.js (server) (yarn)Node.js (server) (npm)PythonReact (yarn)React (npm)
```
1
| <dependency>
---|--- 
2
| <groupId>com.launchdarkly</groupId>
3
| <artifactId>launchdarkly-java-server-sdk</artifactId>
4
| <version>7.0.0</version>
5
| </dependency>
```
 1. Initialize the SDK:
JavaJavaScript (require)JavaScript (es2015)JavaScript (TypeScript).NET (client) (C#)Node.js (server)PythonReact
```
1
| import com.launchdarkly.sdk.*;
---|--- 
2
| import com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.*;
3
| 
4
| // A "context" is a data object representing users, devices, organizations, and
5
| // other entities. You'll need this later, but you can ignore it for now.
6
| final LDContext context = LDContext.builder("example-context-key")
7
| .name("Sandy")
8
| .build();
9
| 
10
| LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder().build();
11
| 
12
| // Set your LaunchDarkly SDK key.
13
| // This is inlined as example only for onboarding.
14
| // Never hardcode your SDK key in production.
15
| final LDClient client = new LDClient("sdk-378e1611-aa33-4fa2-b477-9279c59a6c59", config);
16
| 
17
| if (client.isInitialized()) {
18
| System.out.println("SDK successfully initialized!");
19
| }
```
## Step 2: Create a flag
Next, create a flag to track your experiment. Here’s how:
 1. Click to expand **Step 2: Create a flag**. A flag create menu appears.
 2. Give your flag a human-readable **Name** and click **Create flag**.
 3. Test the flag by wrapping a feature in your app in the flag code. Here’s how:
JavaJavaScript.NET (client)Node.js (server)PythonReact
```
1
| // Set up the evaluation context.
---|--- 
2
| final LDContext context = LDContext.builder("example-context-key")
3
| .name("Sandy")
4
| .build();
5
| 
6
| // Evaluate the feature flag for this context.
7
| boolean flagValue = client.boolVariation('my-cool-flag', context, false);
8
| 
9
| if (flagValue) {
10
| 
11
| // TODO: Put your feature here
12
| 
13
| } else {
14
| 
15
| // TODO: Put your fallback behavior here
16
| 
17
| }
```
 1. Run your application to verify that it works as you expect.
 2. Navigate to the flag’s **Targeting tab** and turn the flag on. To learn more, read [Target with flags](/docs/home/flags/target).
 3. Return to the tab in your browser with the Experimentation quickstart.
## Step 3: Instrument events
Events let you track the raw data that matters for your experiment, like clicks, pageviews, and custom events.
For this quickstart, we recommend you use custom events. You can send them using the [SDK’s track](/docs/sdk/features/events) method. Here’s how:
 1. Click to expand **Step 3: Instrument events**.
 2. Use the code below to instrument events for your experiment.
JavaJavaScript.NET (client)Node.js (server)PythonReact
```
1
| client.track("example-event-key", context);
---|--- 
```
## Step 4: Create a metric
Metrics measure the outcome of an experiment. Conversion metrics compare two different versions against each other to see which produces a better result.
To learn more about how to create metrics, read [Creating and managing metrics](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics).
 1. Click to expand **Step 4: Create a metric**.
 2. Click **Create metric**. The metric creation menu appears.
 3. Enter the **Event key** you instrumented in the previous step.
 4. Choose how you want to measure the conversion event: by Count, Occurrence, or Value / Size.
 5. Give your metric a human-readable **Name**.
 6. Click **Create metric**.
## Step 5: Create an experiment
Now it’s time to create your experiment.
Click to expand **Step 5: Create an experiment** , then click **Create experiment**. The experiment builder appears, and now you’re ready to go!
There are many ways to customize your experiment to track exactly the information you need. Here are some recommendations to create the simplest possible experiment:
 1. Add a clear [hypothesis](/docs/guides/experimentation/designing-experiments#formulate-a-hypothesis) to the experiment.
 2. Choose a feature change experiment to get started as fast as possible.
 3. When you choose a randomization unit, try “users.” Users are the most common randomization unit.
 4. Set up a 50/50 traffic split to see accurate, significant results quickly.
