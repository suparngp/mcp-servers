## Overview
This topic explains how to set up and configure a feature change experiment in LaunchDarkly.
Configuring a feature change experiment requires several steps:
 1. [Creating the flag or AI Config and its variations](/docs/home/experimentation/feature#create-flags-or-ai-configs),
 2. [Creating one or more metrics](/docs/home/experimentation/feature#create-metrics),
 3. [Building the experiment](/docs/home/experimentation/feature#build-experiments),
 4. [Turning on the flag or AI Config](/docs/home/experimentation/feature#turn-on-flags-or-ai-configs), and
 5. [Starting an iteration](/docs/home/experimentation/feature#start-experiment-iterations).
These steps are explained in detail below.
### Prerequisites
Before you build an experiment, you should read about and understand the following concepts:
 * [randomization units](/docs/home/experimentation/randomization)
 * [Bayesian and frequentist statistics](/docs/guides/experimentation/bayesian-frequentist)
## Create flags or AI Configs
Before you begin an experiment, create a flag or AI Config with the variations you plan to test the performance of. You do not need to toggle on the flag before you create an experiment, but you do have to toggle on the flag before you [start an experiment iteration](/docs/home/experimentation/feature#start-experiment-iterations). AI Configs are on by default.
To learn more, read [Creating new flags](/docs/home/flags/new), [Creating flag variations](/docs/home/flags/variations), [Create AI Configs](/docs/home/ai-configs/create), and [Create and manage AI Config variations](/docs/home/ai-configs/create-variation).
You cannot run an experiment on a flag if:
 * the flag has an active [guarded rollout](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts)
 * the flag has an active [progressive rollout](/docs/home/releases/progressive-rollouts)
 * the flag is in a running [Data Export experiment](/docs/home/experimentation/export)
 * the flag is in a running [warehouse native experiment](/docs/home/warehouse-native/creating)
 * the flag is a [migration flag](/docs/home/flags/migration)
You can build and run multiple funnel optimization and feature change experiments on the same flag or AI Config as long as there is only one running experiment per rule. You cannot run multiple experiments on the same rule at the same time.
## Create metrics
Metrics measure audience behaviors affected by your experiments. You can use metrics to track all kinds of things, from how often end users access a URL to how long that URL takes to load a page. You can reuse metrics in multiple experiments, or create new ones for your feature change experiment.
To learn how to create your own new metric, read [Metrics](/docs/home/metrics). LaunchDarkly also automatically creates metrics for AI Configs. To learn more, read [Metrics generated from AI SDK events](/docs/home/metrics/autogen-metrics#metrics-autogenerated-from-ai-sdk-events).
##### Percentile analysis methods for Experimentation are in beta
The default metric analysis method is “Average.” The use of percentile analysis methods with LaunchDarkly experiments is in beta. If you use a metric with a percentile analysis method in a an experiment with a large audience, the experiment results tab may take longer to load, or the results tab may time out and display an error message. Percentile analysis methods are also not compatible with [CUPED adjustments](/docs/guides/statistical-methodology/cuped).
If you want to learn which variation performs better, it must be possible for that metric to measure something in all of the variations within the experiment. To learn more, read [Metrics and flag variations](/docs/guides/experimentation/designing-experiments#metrics-and-variations).
You can use one or more metrics or standard metric groups in feature change experiments. However, you cannot use funnel metric groups in feature change experiments. To learn more, read [Metric groups](/docs/home/metrics/metric-groups).
## Build experiments
You can view all of the experiments in your environment on the **Experiments** list.
To build an experiment:
 1. Click **Create** and choose **Experiment**. The “Create experiment” dialog appears.
 2. Enter an experiment **Name**.
 3. Enter a **Hypothesis**.
 4. Click **Create experiment**. The experiment **Design** tab appears.
 5. Select the **Feature change** experiment type.
 6. Choose a context kind to **Randomize by**.
 7. Select one or more **Metrics** or metric groups.
 * Hover over a metric to see which environments have received events for it. If no environments are receiving events, check that your SDKs are configured correctly.
 * Click **Create** to create and use a new metric or new [standard metric group](/docs/home/metrics/metric-groups).
 8. (Optional) If you have added multiple metrics and want to change the primary metric, hover on the metric name and click the **crown** icon.
![A metric group with the primary metric indicated.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/6cd23025e9765f768ec4b2df8ee0a3ae6bab3061e4c5b2f3a0eaa9bc3cad2eb1/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/experiment-builder-primary-metric-callout.png)
A metric group with the primary metric indicated.
 1. Choose a **Flag or AI Config** to use in the experiment.
 * Click **Create flag** or **Create AI Config** to create and use a new flag or AI Config.
 2. Choose a targeting rule for the **Experiment audience**.
 * If you want to restrict your experiment audience to only contexts with certain attributes, create a targeting rule on the flag or AI Config you include in the experiment and run the experiment on that rule.
 * If you don’t want to restrict the audience for your experiment, run the experiment on the default rule. If the flag or AI Config doesn’t have any targeting rules, the default rule will be the only option.
![The "Audience targeting" section with the default rule chosen.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/39503b0adb7e876fa64cde29342d11ab9b06de5c05a2218fe8c06f7057729d77/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/experiment-builder-define-audience.png)
The "Audience targeting" section with the default rule chosen.
 1. (Optional) If you want to [exclude contexts in this experiment](/docs/home/experimentation/mutually-exclusive) from certain other experiments, click **Add experiment to exclusion layer** and select a layer.
###### Expand layer options
A [layer](/docs/home/experimentation/mutually-exclusive) is a set of experiments that cannot share traffic with each other. All of the experiments within a layer are mutually exclusive, which means that if a context is included in one experiment, LaunchDarkly will exclude it from any other experiments in the same layer.
To add the experiment to an existing layer:
 1. Click **Select layer**.
 2. Search for and choose the layer you want to add the experiment to.
 3. Enter a **Reservation** amount. This is the percentage of the contexts within this layer you want LaunchDarkly to include in this experiment.
 4. Click **Save layer**.
If you need to create a new layer:
 1. Click **Create layer**.
 2. Add a **Name** and **Description**.
 3. Click **Create layer**.
 4. Enter a **Reservation** amount. This is the percentage of the contexts within this layer you want LaunchDarkly to include in this experiment.
 5. Click **Save layer**.
 1. Choose the **Variation served to users outside this experiment**. Contexts that match the selected targeting rule but are not in the experiment will receive this variation.
 2. Select the **Sample size** for the experiment. This is the percentage of all of the contexts that match the experiment’s targeting rule that you want to include in the experiment.
 3. (Optional) Click **Advanced** to edit variation reassignment. For most experiments, we recommend leaving this option on its default setting. To learn more, read [Carryover bias and variation reassignment](/docs/home/experimentation/carryover).
 4. (Optional) Click **Edit** to update the variation split for contexts that are in the experiment.
 * You can **Split equally** between variations, or assign a higher percentage of contexts to some variations than others.
 * Click **Save audience split**.
 5. Select a variation to serve as the **Control**.
 6. Select a **Statistical approach** of Bayesian or frequentist.
 * If you selected a statistical approach of Bayesian, select a preset or **Custom** success threshold.
 * If you selected a statistical approach of frequentist, select:
 * a **Significance level**.
 * a one-sided or two-sided **Direction of hypothesis test**.
###### Expand statistical approach options
You can select a statistical approach of **Bayesian** or **Frequentist**. Each approach includes one or more analysis options.
We recommend **Bayesian** when you have a small sample size of less than a thousand contexts, and we recommend **Frequentist** when you have a larger sample size of a thousand or more.
The Bayesian options include:
 * **Threshold** :
 * **90%** probability to beat control is the standard success threshold, but you can raise the threshold to **95%** or **99%** if you want to be more confident in your experiment results.
 * You can lower the threshold to less than 90% using the **Custom** option. We recommend a lower threshold only when you are experimenting on non-critical parts of your app and are less concerned with determining a clear winning variation.
The frequentist options include:
 1. **Significance level** :
 * **0.05** p-value is the standard significance level, but you can lower the level to **0.01** or raise the level to **0.10** , depending on whether you need to be more or less confident in your results. A lower significance level means that you can be more confident in your winning variation.
 * You can raise the significance level to more than 0.10 using the **Custom** option. We recommend a higher significance level only when you are experimenting on non-critical parts of your app and are less concerned with determining a clear winning variation.
 2. **Direction of hypothesis test** :
 * **Two-sided** : We recommend two-sided when you’re unsure about whether the difference between the control and the treatment variations will be negative or positive, and want to look for indications of statistical significance in both directions.
 * **One-sided** : We recommend one-sided when you feel confident that the difference between the control and treatment variations will be either negative or positive, and want to look for indications of statistical significance only in one direction.
 3. (Optional) Select a [Multiple comparisons correction](/docs/guides/statistical-methodology/mcc) option:
 * Select **Apply across treatments** to correct for additional comparisons from multiple treatments
 * Select **Apply across metrics** to correct for additional comparisons across multiple metrics
 * Select **Apply across both metrics and treatments** to correct for additional comparisons from multiple metrics and multiple treatments
To learn more, read [Bayesian versus frequentist statistics](/docs/guides/experimentation/bayesian-frequentist).
 1. (Optional) If you want to include the experiment in a [holdout](/docs/home/holdouts), click **Advanced** , then select a **Holdout** name.
##### Experiments cannot be in a holdout and in a layer at the same time
Experiments can either be in a holdout or in a layer, but not both. If you added the experiment to a layer, you will not see the option to add it to a holdout.
 1. (Optional) If you want to be able to [filter your experiment results by attribute](/docs/home/experimentation/filters), click **Advanced** , then select up to five context attributes to filter results by.
 2. (Optional) Click **Add tags** in the right sidebar to add new or existing tags to the experiment.
 3. Scroll to the top of the page and click **Save**.
If needed, you can save your in-progress experiment design to finish later. To save your design, click **Save** at the top of the creation screen. Your in-progress experiment design is saved and appears on the **Experiments** list. To finish building the experiment, click on the experiment’s name and continue editing.
After you have created your experiment, the next step is to toggle on the flag. AI Configs are on by default. Then, you can start an iteration.

You can also use the REST API: [Create experiment](/docs/api/experiments/create-experiment)
## Turn on flags or AI Configs
For an experiment to begin recording data, the flag or AI Config used in the experiment must be on. Targeting rules for AI Configs are on by default. To learn how to turn targeting rules on for flags, read [Turning flags on and off](/docs/home/flags/toggle).
## Start experiment iterations
After you create an experiment and toggle on the flag, you can start an experiment iteration in one or more environments.
To start an experiment iteration:
 1. Navigate to the **Experiments** list.
 2. Click on the environment section containing the experiment you want to start.
 * If the environment you need isn’t visible, click the **+** next to the list of environment sections. Search for the environment you want, and select it from the list.
![The environment selection menu.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/34b4f0b3517652a1d52892a144f582c4acfeb5b49bfaf2ffee688fca284f3ce6/assets/images/auto/environment-selection.auto.png)
The environment selection menu.
 1. Click on the name of the experiment you want to start an iteration for. The **Design** tab appears.
 2. Click **Start**.
 3. Repeat steps 1-4 for each environment you want to start an iteration in.
![An experiment with the "Start" button called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/4856586600e776039dac53473c7f3f577efab2d83cf765772a56660a4f528659/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/experiment-details-start-callout.png)
An experiment with the "Start" button called out.
Experiment iterations allow you to record experiments in individual blocks of time. To ensure accurate experiment results, when you make changes that impact an experiment, LaunchDarkly starts a new iteration of the experiment.
To learn more about starting and stopping iterations, read [Starting and stopping experiment iterations](/docs/home/experimentation/start-stop-exp).
