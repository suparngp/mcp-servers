## Overview
This topic explains what randomization units are and how to use them in LaunchDarkly Experimentation. An experiment’s randomization unit is the [context kind](/docs/home/flags/context-kinds) the experiment uses to assign traffic to each of its variations.
When you create an experiment, you will choose a randomization unit that determines both:
 * which context kind the experiment will allocate traffic to different variations by, and
 * which metrics you can use in the experiment.
Most experiments use the `user` randomization unit. This means that the experiment will sort contexts that encounter the experiment into different variations by user. You can also choose a different context kind, like `device` or `organization`.
## Randomization units in metrics and experiments
To use a particular [metric](/docs/home/metrics) within an experiment, the metric and the experiment must use the same context kind as their randomization unit.
You select a metric’s randomization unit when you create it:
![The "Metric definition" section of a new metric with the randomization unit called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/c1f430997989c8e2d46409daf3d076f16bdac1bd14f413efbb8678803dc55cd8/assets/images/auto/metric-randomization-unit.auto.png)
The "Metric definition" section of a new metric with the randomization unit called out.
Later, when you create an experiment, select the same randomization unit to make the metric available to the experiment:

Like experiments, many metrics use a context kind of `user` as their randomization unit, but can also use other kinds depending on what the metric is measuring. To learn more, read [Creating and managing metrics](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics).
## Randomization units other than “user”
In LaunchDarkly, the default context kind of `user` is automatically available for use in Experimentation. If you have created other context kinds, and want to use them as randomization units, you must first make them available for experiments.
Here’s how:
 1. Navigate to the **Contexts** list.
 2. Click the **gear** icon on the right. The context kinds list appears.
 3. Click the **three-dot** overflow menu next to the context kind you want to edit.
 4. Select **Edit**. The “Edit context kind” dialog appears.
 5. Check the **Available for experiments and guarded rollouts** checkbox.
 6. (Optional) Check the **Set as the default for experiments and guarded rollouts** checkbox if you want new experiments to default to this context kind as the randomization unit.
 7. Click **Save**.
## Randomization units and multi-contexts
If you use multi-contexts, you have options as to which context kind you want to use as a randomization unit for an experiment. Expand the section below to view an example.
###### Randomization units and multi-contexts
Imagine the `user` Anna and the `user` Jesse both work for the `organization` Global Health Services. If they are both in an experiment that randomizes by `organization`, Anna and Jesse will always be sorted into the same variation in the experiment, because their contexts share the same `organization`. However, if they are in an experiment that randomizes by `user`, then they could end up in different variations.
Here is what their multi-contexts would look like, though each SDK sends context data to LaunchDarkly in a slightly different format:
Two multi-contexts with the same org key
```
1
| {
---|--- 
2
| "kind": "multi",
3
| "user": {
4
| "key": "user-key-anna", // Anna has a unique user key
5
| "name": "Anna",
6
| },
7
| "organization": {
8
| "key": "org-key-global-health", // The org key is the same in both multi-contexts
9
| "name": "Global Health Services",
10
| }
11
| }
12
| 
13
| {
14
| "kind": "multi",
15
| "user": {
16
| "key": "user-key-jesse", // Jesse has a unique user key
17
| "name": "Jesse",
18
| },
19
| "organization": {
20
| "key": "org-key-global-health", // The org key is the same in both multi-contexts
21
| "name": "Global Health Services",
22
| }
23
| }
```
There are two ways you could randomize the multi-contexts in an experiment:
 * if you randomize by `user`, Anna could be assigned to one variation, and Jesse could be assigned to the other variation because they have different user keys
 * if you randomize by `organization`, Anna and Jesse will both always be assigned to the same variation because they share the same organization key
