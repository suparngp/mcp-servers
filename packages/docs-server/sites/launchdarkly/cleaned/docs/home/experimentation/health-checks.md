## Overview
This topic explains how to use health checks for experiments to verify that you set up your experiment correctly and fix any problems with your configuration.
## What experiment health checks evaluate
Experiment health checks evaluate five conditions:
 * **Exposures** : Whether the context kind encountering your flag or AI Config variations is not the same context kind you chose for the randomization unit.
 * **Sample ratio mismatch (SRM)** : Whether there is a mismatch between the number of contexts expected and the actual number of contexts included in each variation.
 * **Metrics** : Whether or not each metric is tracking the context kind you selected as the experiment’s randomization unit, and whether or not the metric has seen any events in the last 90 days.
 * **Flag or AI Config** : Whether or not the flag or AI Config is receiving evaluations, is toggled on, and is not archived or deprecated.
 * **Targeting rule/audience** : Whether the targeting rule’s context kind matches the experiment’s randomization unit.
### Health check statuses
When you create an experiment, LaunchDarkly provides a health check status at the top of the **Design** , **Results** , and **Traffic** tabs.
The health check statuses include:
 * **Health check waiting** : LaunchDarkly does not have enough information yet about your experiment configuration to determine its health status.
 * **Healthy** : Your flag or AI Config is receiving evaluations, your metrics are tracking events, and your flag or AI Config and metrics are encountering the same context kinds.
 * **Health warnings** : There is at least one problem with your experiment configuration.
 * **Health errors** : There is at least one critical error with your experiment configuration, such as a flag or AI Config toggled off, or a sample ratio mismatch (SRM).
Hover over the status to view your experiment’s health checks:
![an experiment with a health warning.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/3a4e9d33f7712d0af49109ecd1c955c39b5a94ad6591b67238e1308d4e927e0a/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/experiment-health-check.png)
an experiment with a health warning.
The individual health checks are explained below.
## Exposures
When you create an experiment, you will select a context kind to use as a [randomization unit](/docs/home/experimentation/randomization). The exposures check alerts you if the context kind encountering your flag or AI Config variations is not the same context kind you chose for the randomization unit.
If no contexts of the correct context kind have been evaluated by the flag or AI Config, you may need to [update the randomization unit for the experiment](/docs/home/experimentation/edit-archive) or [adjust the flag or AI Config targeting rule](/docs/home/flags/target-rules) to target the correct context kind.
## Sample ratio mismatch (SRM)
In an experiment, the sample ratio is the ratio between end users or other contexts in each of your experiment variations. An SRM is a mismatch between the number of contexts expected and the actual number of contexts included in each variation.
The sample ratio mismatch check alerts you to any detected SRMs. To learn how to correct these, read [Understanding sample ratios](/docs/guides/statistical-methodology/sample-ratios).
## Metrics
Any metrics you use in the experiment must use the same randomization unit that you selected for your experiment configuration.
The metrics health check displays the following statuses:
 * Whether or not each metric is tracking the context kind you selected as the experiment’s randomization unit. If a metric is tracking the wrong context kind, either choose a different metric, change the randomization unit for the experiment, or [change the randomization unit for the metric](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics#edit-metrics).
 * Whether or not each metric has seen any events in the last 90 days. If a metric has not seen any events in the last 90 days, you may want to confirm that your metric is configured to look for the correct event key.
## Flag or AI Config
The flag or AI Config health check displays the following statuses:
 * Whether or not the flag or AI Config is receiving evaluations from your SDK. If the flag or AI Config is new, it may not be receiving evaluations yet. However, if it is not receiving evaluations and you expect it to be, we recommend that you review your SDK configuration.
 * Whether or not the flag or AI Config is [toggled on](/docs/home/flags/toggle). The flag or AI Config must be on before you can start an [experiment iteration](/docs/home/experimentation/start-stop-exp).
 * Whether or not the flag or AI Config is archived or deprecated. If the flag or AI Config is archived or deprecated, you must restore it to live status, or use a different flag or AI Config.
## Targeting rule/audience
The targeting rule/audience health check displays whether the targeting rule’s context kind matches the experiment’s randomization unit. If they do not match, you may need to [update the randomization unit for the experiment](/docs/home/experimentation/edit-archive) or [adjust the flag or AI Config targeting rule](/docs/home/flags/target-rules) to target the correct context kind.
If the rule targets a segment, you may need to confirm that the contexts kind targeted by the segment match the context kind used by the targeting rule.
