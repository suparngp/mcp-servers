  "description": "This topic explains how to manage and use tools in AI Configs. Tools are reusable, versioned definitions that let AI Configs trigger actions you define in code. Tools allow large language models (LLMs) to retrieve data or take actions on behalf of a user. You can attach tools to variations or agents. The tools library provides a central location to maintain consistency across projects."
