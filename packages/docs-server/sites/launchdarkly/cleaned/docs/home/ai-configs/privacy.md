## Overview
This topic describes how the LaunchDarkly AI Configs product treats personally identifiable information (PII).
## Privacy and PII in LaunchDarkly
End-user data is information about your customers that your application sends to LaunchDarkly as part of a [context](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#context). End user data can include PII, including names, email addresses, or other unique identifiers, depending on how you define your [context attributes](/docs/home/flags/context-attributes).
The AI Configs product works similarly to LaunchDarkly feature flags with respect to PII in end-user data. Specifically:
 * We recommend that you use [private attributes](/docs/home/flags/private-context-attributes) when you target on PII or other sensitive data. To learn more, read [Minimizing LaunchDarkly’s access to end user data](/docs/guides/account/user-data).
 * If your organization prohibits sending PII to AI providers, then you must take care not to include PII in any of the context attributes that you reference in the messages in your AI Config variations. LaunchDarkly does not have guardrails that prevent you from sending PII from your application to LaunchDarkly, or from LaunchDarkly to a third party, such as an AI model.
## LaunchDarkly and AI models
LaunchDarkly is not integrating directly into the response from any AI provider.
When you work with AI Configs, LaunchDarkly does not send any information you provide to any AI provider or model, and does not use any information you provide as part of an AI Config to fine-tune any models. This includes information you provide when you create an AI Config and its variations, as well as the information you provide in context attributes.
If you use variables within your [AI Config variation messages](/docs/home/ai-configs/create-variation), either from a context attribute or directly from your application, LaunchDarkly substitutes the values of those variables into the message. If your organization prohibits sending PII to AI providers, then you must take care not to include PII in any of the variables that you reference in the messages in your AI Config variations.
