## Overview
This topic explains what metrics are, why to use them, and where to find them in LaunchDarkly.
Metrics measure audience behaviors that change in response to feature flags. You can use metrics to understand how a flag variation affects customer actions, system performance, or business outcomes. Connecting metrics to your flags lets you evaluate impact, compare variations, and make release decisions based on data.
Metrics help you:
 * Measure how a release affects customer behavior or system performance
 * Detect regressions or unexpected effects during a rollout
 * Apply consistent measurement across experiments and guarded rollouts
 * Increase confidence in experiment and release results
##### Archived metrics are hidden
By default, LaunchDarkly hides archived metrics from the metrics list, experiment setup screens, and metric selection menus. To view them, turn on the **Show archived** filter in the metrics list.
![The Metrics list.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/ed14f0ff2b68e1a8f4981fab433efaa56bfbc85100ee8b068338f5e0cf2ff54f/assets/images/auto/metric-list.auto.png)
The Metrics list.
You can search for a metric by name or description. To learn how to create, edit, archive, and delete metrics, read [Creating and managing metrics](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics). Consistent use of metrics gives your organization a single, reliable source of truth for experimentation and release health.
## How to manage metrics
You can manage metrics from the **Metrics** section of the LaunchDarkly user interface.
From this section, you can:
 * View all metrics in a project
 * Create, edit, or archive metrics
 * Group related metrics for reuse
 * Review how metrics connect to experiments, rollouts, and dashboards
To learn how to browse, search, and filter metrics, read [Using the Metrics list](/docs/home/metrics/metrics-list).
## How to use metrics
You can connect metrics to several LaunchDarkly features:
 * **Experiments:** Evaluate how a flag variation affects conversion rate, latency, or engagement
 * **Guarded rollouts:** Track key performance and reliability metrics during progressive releases
 * **Dashboards:** Monitor performance trends across product areas
LaunchDarkly records the version of each metric at the time it is used. If you later update a metric, LaunchDarkly continues to use the original version for analyses already in progress.
