## Overview
This topic discusses using feature management at a high level, describes some key parts of the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI), and suggests different ways to learn more about working in LaunchDarkly.
## About feature management
Feature management is a framework for feature flag-driven development, testing, and experimentation. The basic unit of feature management is a feature flag.
To start using feature management, first create a feature flag in LaunchDarkly. A feature flag describes the different variations of a feature and the rules that allow different entities to access them. Different entities that access your features could be a percentage of your application’s traffic, individuals, or people or software entities who share common characteristics like location, email domain, or type of mobile device. The entities that encounter feature flags in your product are called “contexts.” To learn more, read [Create flags](/docs/home/flags/create) and [Contexts](/docs/home/flags/contexts).
Next, you need to connect your application to LaunchDarkly. You can connect to LaunchDarkly using any of our 20+ SDKs. To learn more, read [SDKs](/docs/sdk).
Then, in your application, use the SDK to make a function call any time you want to determine whether a context should receive a feature, and what variation of the feature it should receive. The SDKs use local caching to make these variation checks as efficient as possible. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/docs/sdk/features/evaluating).
The SDKs send analytics events to LaunchDarkly to record each context that encounters a flag and which variation it received. If you want LaunchDarkly to use certain data for flag evaluation but not store it, you can designate that data as private.
To begin, try our [Quickstart guide](/docs/home/getting-started). To learn more, read the [Getting started in different roles](/docs/home/getting-started/roles) section that best describes your role.
## The Flags list and the LaunchDarkly UI
After you join an account, you have access to the **Flags** list:
![The Flags list.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/c0fb4e456fce003148cc9aeda03d1dfd512cc295eb242afc0d214fcc2cf116c3/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/flags-list.png)
The Flags list.
From the **Flags** list, you can navigate to LaunchDarkly’s primary features:
 * [Feature flags](/docs/home/flags/create): definitions of your feature flags and how their variations target contexts and segments that use your product
 * [Contexts](/docs/home/flags/contexts): people, services, machines, and other resources that encounter feature flags in your product
 * [Segments](/docs/home/flags/segments): groups of contexts targeted by attribute
 * [Experiments](/docs/home/experimentation): measure the impact of features you roll out to your app or infrastructure
 * [Live events](/docs/home/releases/live-events): real-time insight into the events your app is sending to LaunchDarkly
 * [Change history](/docs/home/releases/change-history): a running tally of changes made to feature flags
 * [Integrations](/docs/integrations): third-party integrations that let you configure the product to your specific needs
 * Account settings: manage [members](/docs/home/account/members), [projects](/docs/home/account/project), [roles](/docs/home/account/roles), [authorization](/docs/home/account/secure), and more
Additional help is available, including the command palette, a chatbot, and a link to your personal settings.
### The command palette
You can use the command palette to navigate the app, search for resources, and perform common actions using only your keyboard. Use `CMD`+`K` (Mac) or `CTRL`+`K` (PC) to open the command palette.
![The command palette.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/2f27b4fbb0cc59b8c80d082e2eb85e179a56c71247252e59fdde5850d5980e25/assets/images/auto/getting-started-search-bar.auto.png)

 * [Video overview](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/channel/mli3h9o3nh?wchannelid=mli3h9o3nh&wmediaid=c9x1gyt42d): A video explaining the concept of feature flags.
 * [LaunchDarkly onboarding](https://academy.launchdarkly.com/page/customer-success-program): A series of videos covering a variety of getting started topics.
 * [LaunchDarkly Academy](https://academy.launchdarkly.com/): Guided tutorials, virtual labs, and other interactive educational content.
 * [LaunchDarkly YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LaunchDarkly/videos): Videos covering integration demos, SDK overviews, a user interface (UI) tutorial, and more.
After you join an account, set up your SDK, and begin using feature flags, you may want to ask some questions about your organization’s implementation:
 * Do we use both _temporary_ and _permanent_ flags in our codebase?
 * What naming conventions and styles are used for our different resources such as flags, segments, projects, and environments?
 * How do we manage flag cleanup?
 * Is there a standardized rollout strategy for new features?
 * What LaunchDarkly role am I assigned and what does that mean?
To learn more about making these determinations, read our [Guides](/docs/guides).
