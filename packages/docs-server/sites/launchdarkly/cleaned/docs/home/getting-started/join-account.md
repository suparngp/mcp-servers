## Overview
This topic explains how to join LaunchDarkly as a new account member.
##### LaunchDarkly is for groups and organizations
You cannot sign up for LaunchDarkly if your email address is not associated with your organization’s account. Instead, an administrator or account owner from your organization must send you an invitation email.
If you want to sign up for LaunchDarkly as an individual, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://app.launchdarkly.com/signup).
## Join your organization’s existing account
You can join your organization’s LaunchDarkly account in one of two ways:
 * An admin can invite you to your organization’s account
 * You can request access if your organization has enabled domain matching
You can use the same email address across multiple LaunchDarkly accounts. To learn more, read [Using one email for multiple accounts](/docs/home/account/multiple-accounts).
### Joining through an invitation from a LaunchDarkly Admin
When an Admin invites you to your organization’s LaunchDarkly account, you will receive an email from LaunchDarkly. Follow the instructions in the email to create your account and join your organization.
### Joining through domain matching
To request access through domain matching:
 1. Navigate to the [Signup page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/signup).
 2. Complete and submit the signup form. LaunchDarkly sends a verification email to the email address you provided.
 3. Click the verification link.
 4. If your organization has domain matching enabled, a list of organizations to which you can request access appears.
 5. Select your organization from the list and click “Request access.”
If your organization does not have domain matching enabled, completing the signup form in step 1 will create a new account with a 14-day trial. To learn more, read [Enable domain matching](/docs/home/account/org-settings#enable-domain-matching).
##### Email addresses are case sensitive
You must use your email address to join a LaunchDarkly account. The email address you enter during initial setup is case sensitive. Future attempts to log in with that email address will fail if you use different casing.
For example, if you sign up as `example@your-work-email.com` and later log in as `EXAMPLE@Your-Work-Email.com`, the login attempt will fail.
## Inviting other members to LaunchDarkly
To learn how to invite other members to LaunchDarkly as an Admin, read [Add members to LaunchDarkly](/docs/home/account/members#add-members-to-launchdarkly).
