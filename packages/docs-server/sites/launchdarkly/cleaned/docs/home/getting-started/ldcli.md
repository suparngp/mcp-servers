## Overview
This topic describes how to get started with the LaunchDarkly CLI.
LaunchDarkly provides a command line interface (CLI) so that you can set up and manage your feature flags, account members, projects, environments, teams, and other resources directly from the command line.
## Installation
The LaunchDarkly CLI is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
To install the LaunchDarkly CLI:
Install on macOS with HomebrewInstall on macOS, Windows, or Linux with npmPull from DockerBuild from sourceDownload executable from GitHub
```
$
| brew tap launchdarkly/homebrew-tap
---|--- 
>
| brew install ldcli
```
To update to the latest version of the LaunchDarkly CLI:
Update to latest version using HomebrewUpdate to latest version using npm
```
$
| brew upgrade ldcli
---|--- 
```
## Get started
To get started with the LaunchDarkly CLI, you need to authenticate yourself. Then, you can use [`setup`](/docs/home/getting-started/ldcli#setup) to create and set up your first flag, run any of the ldcli [commands](/docs/home/getting-started/ldcli-commands).
### Authentication
Before you run commands in the LaunchDarkly CLI, you need to authenticate yourself. You have a few options:
 * Authenticate with your email and password. The `login` command provides a login link to the LaunchDarkly UI, requests your approval for the LaunchDarkly CLI to access your account information, and then stores an appropriate access token in the LaunchDarkly CLI’s configuration file.
 * Authenticate with an access token that you create, and use the `config` command to set the token for your session. The `config` command to controls authorization and other configuration values.
 * Authenticate with an access token that you create, and pass the access token each command you run.
Here’s how:
Authenticate with your loginAuthenticate with an access token, onceAuthenticate with an access token, per command
```
$
| # you only need to run this once
---|--- 
>
| ldcli login
```
To learn how to create an access token, read [Creating API access tokens](/docs/home/account/api-create).
### Setup
The `setup` command provides a step-by-step guide to create a flag, install an SDK, and toggle that flag:
Run ldcli setup
```
$
| ldcli setup
---|--- 
```
## Additional documentation
LaunchDarkly provides the following additional documentation:
 * For more information about common commands, read [LaunchDarkly CLI commands](/docs/home/getting-started/ldcli-commands).
 * For details on how to use the LaunchDarkly CLI to perform local testing and development, read [Using the LaunchDarkly CLI for local testing](/docs/guides/flags/ldcli-dev-server) and read [LaunchDarkly CLI dev-server reference](/docs/guides/flags/ldcli-dev-server-reference).
You can also use the `ldcli [command] --help` command to view usage information for all commands for the LaunchDarkly CLI.
