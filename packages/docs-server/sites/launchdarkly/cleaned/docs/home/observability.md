##### This feature is in Early Access
LaunchDarkly’s observability features are publicly available in early access. Enable observability in the billing page.
They currently require the LaunchDarkly [observability SDKs](/docs/sdk/observability) and the JavaScript, React Web, or Vue SDK.
If you are interested in participating in the Early Access Program for our upcoming observability plugins for server-side SDKs, [sign up here](https://launchdarkly.com/early-access/).
##### RBAC is not available for LaunchDarkly observability products
Role-based access control (RBAC) is not supported for LaunchDarkly’s observability features. All account members can view observability data and update observability configurations regardless of their LaunchDarkly default or custom roles.
## Overview
This section contains documentation on LaunchDarkly’s observability features.
LaunchDarkly’s observability features let you understand how your application is performing and how end users are interacting with it. You can use the features to identify bugs, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance.
Before you can use LaunchDarkly’s observability features, you must configure specific plugins in the SDK. To learn more, read the SDK documentation on [Observability SDKs](/docs/sdk/observability).
There are four main observability features. You can find them in the LaunchDarkly UI in the left navigation, under the “Monitor” heading:
 * [Session replay](/docs/home/observability/session-replay)
 * [Errors](/docs/home/observability/errors)
 * [Logs](/docs/home/observability/logs)
 * [Traces](/docs/home/observability/traces)
To learn more about the search specification for all of the observability features, read [Search specification](/docs/home/observability/search).
To learn how to configure project-level settings for the observability features, read [Observability settings](/docs/home/observability/settings).
