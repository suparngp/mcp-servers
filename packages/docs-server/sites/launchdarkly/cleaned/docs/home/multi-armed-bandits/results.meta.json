  "description": "This topic explains how to read the results of a multi-armed bandit (MAB). MABs automatically shift traffic to the leading variation over time, so you do not need to actively monitor a MAB, and you do not need to manually ship the leading variation. However, you can still use the **Results** tab to view the performance of each variation, and understand how the MAB is reallocating traffic."
