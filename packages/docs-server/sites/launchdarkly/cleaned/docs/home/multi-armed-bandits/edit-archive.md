## Overview
This topic explains how to edit a multi-armed bandit (MAB) and archive it when you no longer need it.
## Edit multi-armed bandits
You can make changes to the name, goal, randomization unit, metrics, and audience of an existing MAB. Changing the audience of a running MAB requires you to stop the MAB, update the audience, and then start a new iteration.
After you create a MAB, you cannot edit its flag or the flag’s variations. If you want to use a different flag or a different flag variation, you must create a new MAB.
### Change multi-armed bandit settings
You can change a MAB’s name and goal at any time without affecting the results of the MAB.
If you want to begin measuring a completely different randomization unit or metric as part of a MAB, we recommend creating a new MAB instead of editing an existing one. If you want to use a similar metric, you can change the metric associated with a MAB.
To change a MAB’s name, goal, metric, or randomization unit:
 1. Navigate to the **Design** tab of your MAB.
 2. Click **Edit design**.
 3. Edit the **Name** or **Goal** as needed.
 4. Choose new **Metrics** as needed.
 5. Choose a new randomization unit from the **Randomize by** menu as needed.
 6. Scroll to the top of the page and click **Save**.
 * If the MAB was running when you made edits, a “Save multi-armed bandit design?” dialog appears. Enter a reason for the change and click **Save & start new iteration**.
### Change multi-armed bandit audiences
To edit the audience of a MAB, you must stop the MAB iteration, make the audience update, and start a new iteration. This lets you select a flag variation to serve to any contexts that will no longer be included in the MAB.
To edit the audience of a MAB:
 1. Navigate to the **Design** tab of your MAB.
 2. Click **Stop**. The “Stop multi-armed bandit” dialog appears.
 3. Select a variation to serve while the MAB is stopped.
 4. Enter a **Reason for stopping**.
 5. Click **Stop multi-armed bandit**.
 6. Click **Edit design**.
 7. Navigate to the “Audience targeting” section and update the **Experiment audience** as needed.
 * You can also update the **Sample size** if you need to change the percentage of contexts to serve the MAB to.

 1. Scroll to the top of the page and click **Save**.
 2. Click **Start** to start a new iteration of the MAB.
## Archive and restore multi-armed bandits
You can archive MABs that have concluded, as well as the flags and metrics attached to them, but you cannot permanently delete MABs. Archiving MABs preserves the results so you can refer to them in the future.
Before you can archive a MAB:
 * The MAB must not be running. To learn how to stop a MAB, read [Stop experiment iterations](/docs/home/experimentation/start-stop-exp#stop-experiment-iterations).
 * The MAB must not be included in a layer. To learn how to remove a MAB from a layer, read [Remove experiments from layers](/docs/home/experimentation/mutually-exclusive#remove-experiments-from-layers).
LaunchDarkly hides archived MABs from the **Multi-armed bandits** list. You cannot start new iterations for archived MABs.
When you archive or restore a MAB, LaunchDarkly sends the maintainer and anyone following the MAB an email, an in-app notification, and, if you have the Slack app integration configured, a Slack notification.
### Archive multi-armed bandits
To archive a MAB:
 1. Navigate to the **Multi-armed bandits** list in the environment where you want to archive a MAB.
 2. Click on the **three-dot** overflow menu of the MAB you want to archive.
 3. Select **Archive**.
To view archived MABs on the **Multi-armed bandits** list, click **Filters** and select **Yes** in the “Archived” section.
To switch back to viewing active MABs, click **View** and select **No** in the “Archived” section.
### Restore multi-armed bandits
To restore a MAB, navigate to the MAB **Design** tab and click **restore this multi-armed bandit**.
##### Multi-armed bandit settings are environment-specific
MABs and MAB settings are specific to single environments. If you want to run the same MAB in different environments, you must create and run the MAB in each environment individually.
