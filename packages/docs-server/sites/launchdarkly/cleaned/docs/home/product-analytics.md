##### Contact us to enable product analytics
LaunchDarkly product analytics is available for all customers but requires an extra step to enable. To learn more, contact us.
## Overview
LaunchDarkly offers a warehouse-native product analytics solution that allows you to compose your own dashboards out of different events and user data. Product analytics lets you analyze your product data and get insights.
## Warehouse-native product analytics
Warehouse-native product analytics solutions are analytics platforms built to work directly with your existing data warehouse. Unlike traditional analytics platforms that come with their own database and require ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to move data into that database, warehouse-native solutions access the data where it resides. You don’t need to move or copy data from your warehouse to another database. This saves time and resources.
Product analytics supports evolving data sources and scales with the event volumes associated with large amounts of data. You can filter and visualize your product data precisely the way you want. LaunchDarkly product analytics offer powerful capabilities that can help you go deep into your data and know more about customer behavior.
## Prerequisites
In order to use product analytics, you must have the following prerequisites:
 * Events populating LaunchDarkly’s event stream
 * Access to a supported data warehouse, such as [Snowflake](/docs/home/product-analytics/setup/snowflake), [BigQuery](/docs/home/product-analytics/setup/bigquery), or [Databricks](/docs/home/product-analytics/setup/databricks)
 * (Optional) Access to LaunchDarkly’s [Data Export](/docs/integrations/data-export) feature
## Product analytics components
There are several key concepts behind LaunchDarkly product analytics. Each of these components is described in its own tab in the product analytics UI.
 * [Events](/docs/home/product-analytics/chart/events): Unique actions on your product. For example, a user clicking a checkout button or a user signing up.
 * [Cohorts](/docs/home/product-analytics/chart/cohorts): Specific groups of users segmented by properties or behaviors. For example, all users who signed up in the past 30 days.
 * [Attributes](/docs/home/product-analytics/chart/attributes): Identifying traits that describe events. For example, the country a user was located in when they signed up.
 * [User activity](/docs/home/product-analytics/chart/user-activity): User activity over time. For example, the number of users who signed up each day.

## Controlling access to product analytics
Members with a Reader base role can view product analytics dashboards, but cannot create, delete, or modify anything in product analytics. Members with a Writer, Admin, or Owner base role can view, create, delete, and modify product analytics dashboards.
To learn more, read [Organization roles](/docs/home/account/roles/organization-roles).
