## Overview
This topic explains how to create and manage progressive rollouts to release new features incrementally.
##### Progressive rollouts and charts
Progressive rollouts do not include metric monitoring or relative difference charts. Metrics and charts are only available for guarded rollouts.
## Create a progressive rollout
You can create a progressive rollout on any flag targeting rule, as long as there are no other progressive rollouts, [guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts), or [experiments](/docs/home/experimentation) running on the flag and the flag is not a [migration flag](/docs/home/flags/migration). You need a [role](/docs/home/account/roles) with the ability to update flag rules in order to create a progressive rollout. The LaunchDarkly Project Admin, Maintainer, and Developer project roles, as well as the Writer, Admin, and Owner base roles, all include this ability.
To create a progressive rollout:
 1. Navigate to the flag’s **Targeting** tab.
 2. Find the flag targeting rule for which you want to create a progressive rollout and click **Edit**.
 3. From the **Serve** menu select “Progressive rollout.” The progressive rollout configuration options appear.
 * The **Progressive rollout** option is disabled if there is already a progressive or guarded rollout on another targeting rule, or if there is an experiment running.
 1. For boolean flags, or other flags with only two variations:
 * The **Variation** field specifies the variation to serve. All customers receive this variation when the variation is complete. You do not have control over when in the course of the rollout a specific customer starts receiving this variation.
 1. For multivariate flags:
 * Select the **From** variation to serve. All customers who are not yet part of a rollout step receive this variation.
 * Select the **To** variation to serve. All customers receive this variation when the variation is complete. You do not have control over when in the course of the rollout a specific customer starts receiving the **To** variation.
 1. Select the **Context kind to roll out by**.
 * If you are adding the progressive rollout to the default rule, this can be any context kind.
 * If you are adding the progressive rollout to a targeting rule, we strongly recommend setting this to the same context kind selected in the targeting rule.
 1. Fill in the progression you would like for the rollout.
 * (Optional) Adjust the percentage of traffic and the duration of each step.
 * (Optional) Click the **three-dot** overflow menu next to a step to add a new step or delete the current step.
 1. Click **Review and save**.
The progressive rollout begins immediately after you save your changes. It continues for the total duration you have specified. To learn how to stop the rollout before it is complete, read [Stop a progressive rollout](/docs/home/releases/create-progressive-rollouts#stop-a-progressive-rollout), below.
Here is an image of the default progressive rollout configuration options:

## View progress of a progressive rollout
When a progressive rollout is active, a progress icon appears on the **Flags** list:
![The Flags list, showing a flag that has a progressive rollout, with the progress icon called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/34fd6f23a1e3379f21792c476a3881ccd82145feb4733d8c692ff522cb86a530/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/progressive-rollouts-flags-list.png)

You can view details from the flag’s **Targeting** tab. LaunchDarkly displays the rollout steps on the flag targeting rule:

You cannot edit a flag targeting rule that is currently part of a rollout.
When a progressive rollout completes, you receive an email notification if you started the rollout or if you are [following](/docs/home/flags/list#follow-flags) the flag.
## Stop a progressive rollout
To stop a progressive rollout that is in progress:
 1. Navigate to the flag’s **Targeting** tab.
 2. Find the flag targeting rule with a progressive rollout.
 3. Click **Stop** :
![A flag targeting rule with a progressive rollout, with the "Stop" button called out.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/fd159fd565611bdf7f531d97bc42d4c52ded030474b357a0d947ce49b98055d5/assets/images/auto/progressive-rollout-stop.auto.png)
A flag targeting rule with a progressive rollout, with the "Stop" button called out.
 1. In the “Stop progressive rollout” dialog, choose whether to serve the **Current percentage** or a particular variation.
 * Choose a specific variation to serve that variation to all traffic for this rule.
 * Choose **Current percentage** to serve a [percentage rollout](/docs/home/getting-started/vocabulary#percentage-rollout) for this rule. With this option, LaunchDarkly will reallocate traffic using the standard [percentage rollout logic](/docs/home/releases/percentage-rollouts#percentage-rollout-logic). This means a customer who is receiving one variation as part of the progressive rollout may start receiving a different variation when the progressive rollout stops. The overall percentage of customers receiving each variation will remain at the current levels.
 1. Click **Next**.
 2. Review the changes you are making to the rule.
 3. (Optional) Choose one or more reviewers from the **Request approval** menu. This is required if your environment [requires approvals](/docs/home/releases/approvals).
 4. (Optional) Enter a **Comment** about your change. This is required if your environment [requires comments](/docs/home/releases/comments).
 5. Click **Save changes**.
When a progressive rollout is stopped, the member who started the rollout and any members who are [following](/docs/home/flags/list#follow-flags) the flag receive an email notification.
