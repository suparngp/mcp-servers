##### Required comments are available to customers on select plans
Required comments are only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
## Overview
This topic explains how to use required comments for feature flag and segment changes.
Comments help establish a change history for a flag or segment. Requiring members to leave comments when they change flags or segments helps your organization understand why flags or segments look and behave certain ways.
##### Required comments are only enforced from the user interface
When **Require comments** is enabled, members must leave a comment to explain their changes when they make changes from the **Flags** list or the **Segments** list in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI). Comments are not required for changes made with the LaunchDarkly API.
When you require comments in an environment, members must leave a comment when saving any changes to a flag:
