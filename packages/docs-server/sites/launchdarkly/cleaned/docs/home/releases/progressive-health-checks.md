## Overview
Use health checks for progressive rollouts to confirm your rollout setup and troubleshoot configuration problems. Progressive rollouts gradually increase traffic to a flag or AI Config variation over time. Health checks confirm that your rollout configuration is valid by verifying that your flag is turned on and receiving evaluations from the correct context kind.
## Health check statuses
When you create a progressive rollout, LaunchDarkly provides a health check status next to the the **Progressive rollout** header. LaunchDarkly processes the rollout configuration and displays one of the following statuses:
 * **Healthy** : Your flag or AI Config is turned on and receiving evaluations from the expected context kind.
 * **Health warnings** : There is at least one problem with your rollout configuration.
Click the status to view your rollout’s health checks:

Health check status showing a healthy progressive rollout.
The individual health checks are explained below.
## Flag evaluations
This health check verifies that the flag is receiving evaluations from the context kind you selected for the rollout.
The health check can display the following messages:
 * **[context kind] contexts are evaluating your flag** : The flag is receiving evaluations from the expected context kind.
 * **[context kind] contexts are not evaluating your flag** : The flag is receiving evaluations from, but not from the expected context kind.
 * **Flag is not receiving evaluations** : Either your flag is not configured correctly in your code, or your SDK is not set up correctly.
You can expand the [Evaluations graph](/docs/home/releases/flag-evaluations) at the top of the flag **Targeting** tab to view how many contexts are encountering the flag and which variation they are receiving.
