  "description": "This topic explains how to customize approval requests for each environment in your LaunchDarkly project. For example, you can prevent LaunchDarkly from applying a proposed change if any reviewer declines an approval request for your Production environment. Or, you may allow anyone, including the person making the approval request, to approve and apply a proposed change in your QA environment."
