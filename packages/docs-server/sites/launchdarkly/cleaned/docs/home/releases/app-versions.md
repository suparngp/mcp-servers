## Overview
This topic explains how to create, edit, and delete application versions.
LaunchDarkly automatically creates application versions when a LaunchDarkly SDK evaluates a feature flag that contains application version information. You can edit and delete application versions from the **Versions** page of an existing application in the LaunchDarkly UI.
## Create application versions
Similar to [creating an application](/docs/home/releases/applications#create-applications), LaunchDarkly automatically creates new application versions when it establishes a connection with a LaunchDarkly SDK that supports [Application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config).
We strongly recommend also enabling automatic environment attribute collection as part of your SDK configuration. When this configuration is enabled, the SDK provides data on the mobile environment where an application is running, including the application version name and id. The SDK includes this data in the `ld_application` and `ld_device` contexts. To learn more, read [Automatic environment attributes](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes).
After the SDK has evaluated at least one feature flag using an `ld_application` context, you can create mobile targeting rules based on application and application version information in that context. To learn more, read [Mobile targeting](/docs/home/flags/mobile-targeting).
##### Add mobile targeting rules only after application version information is collected
You can only create a “Mobile” targeting rule, and target mobile apps and devices based on automatically collected application version information, if you have completed the following:
 * your feature flag has its “Available on mobile SDKs” toggle set to **On**. To learn more, read [Creating new flags](/docs/home/flags/new). LaunchDarkly accounts created after October 21, 2025 have this box checked by default.
 * you have already started to collect application information in the `ld_application` and `ld_device` context kinds. LaunchDarkly must receive these context kinds before it enables the option to create a mobile targeting rule. To learn more, read [Automatic environment attributes](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes).
## Edit application versions
You can only edit an application version’s support status. Only application versions for “mobile” application kinds include a support status.
To edit an application version’s support status:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Applications**.
 3. Find the application whose versions you want to edit and click its name. The application’s **Versions** page appears.
 4. In the list of versions, find the version you want to edit.
 5. Click the **overflow** menu and choose “Edit support status.”
 6. In the “Edit version support status” dialog, select the new **Support status**.
 7. Click **Save**.
You cannot modify an application version name or key.
##### Ensure your application key is unique per distributed application
Before you mark an application version as unsupported, make sure that the application key is unique for each separately distributed software binary.
For example, suppose you have a mobile app, “Example app,” that you distribute on both iOS and Android. Initially you create one application, with application key “example-app” and application version “1.0”. However, if you set the “1.0” application version to unsupported, then if you create a flag targeting rule based only on the supported status, the flag will target both iOS and Android. This may not be what you intend.
We recommend that you create different applications for each separately distributed software binary, and set the application key to a different value for each. To learn more, read [Application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config).

## Delete application versions
To delete an existing application version:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Applications**.
 3. Find the application whose versions you want to delete and click its name. The application’s **Versions** page appears.
 4. In the list of versions, find the version you want to delete.
 5. Click the **overflow** menu and choose “Delete.”
 6. In the dialog, type the name or key of the version to confirm.
 7. Click **Delete**.
