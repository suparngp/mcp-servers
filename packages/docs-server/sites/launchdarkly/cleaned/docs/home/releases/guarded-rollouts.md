##### Guarded rollouts availability
Guarded rollouts are available to customers on a Guardian plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
All LaunchDarkly accounts include a limited trial of guarded rollouts. Use this to evaluate the feature in real-world releases.
## Overview
This topic explains how to use metrics with guarded rollouts to monitor the performance of flag and AI Config releases and configure LaunchDarkly to take action on the results.
![An active guarded rollout on a flag change.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/1c6b490e04ea1b076b3947e5027ce6bb257ced81fe7539bbaafada3c853ef1af/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/guarded-rollout-in-progress.png)
An active guarded rollout on a flag change.
When you begin serving a new flag or AI Config variation, such as when you toggle a flag on or update the default rule variation, you can choose to add a guarded rollout. A guarded rollout progressively increases traffic to the new variation over time while monitoring chosen metrics for [regressions](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts#regressions), until 100% of your audience is receiving the new variation. If LaunchDarkly detects a regression before you reach 100%, it can stop the release and send you a notification.
In a guarded rollout, each metric appears in its own tile. Each tile contains a relative difference chart. The chart shows how the treatment compares to the control over time. A dark grey line represents the relative difference as a percentage, with a shaded grey confidence interval and a dotted line for the regression threshold you selected.
If the entire credible interval goes above the threshold line for lower-is-better metrics, or below the threshold line for higher-is-better metrics, LaunchDarkly calls a regression. When this occurs, the tile highlights the regression. If automatic rollback is enabled, LaunchDarkly also reverts the rollout.
##### Minimum context requirement for guarded rollouts
A new flag or AI Config variation must be evaluated by a minimum number of contexts during each step of a guarded rollout. If this minimum sample size for guarded rollouts isn’t met, LaunchDarkly automatically rolls back the change.
Guarded rollouts are one of several options that LaunchDarkly provides to help you release features to production safely and gradually. To learn about other options for releasing features, read [Releasing features with LaunchDarkly](/docs/home/releases/releasing).
You can create a guarded rollout on any targeting rule, as long as there are no other guarded rollouts, [progressive rollouts](/docs/home/releases/progressive-rollouts), or [experiments](/docs/home/experimentation) running on the flag or AI Config, and the flag is not a [migration flag](/docs/home/flags/migration).
## View flags with guarded rollouts
To view a list of flags that are currently using or have previously used a guarded rollout, click **Guarded rollouts** in the left nav. Hover over a flag’s **heart** icon to view more information about the guarded rollout:

You can use the **Filters** menu to filter the list by rollout status. Navigate to the flag’s **Monitoring** tab to [view and manage the rollout](/docs/home/releases/managing-guarded-rollouts).
AI Configs with guarded rollouts do not appear on the **Guarded rollouts** list.
## Metrics and guarded rollouts
You can use metrics to track a variety of system health indicators and end-user behaviors, from engineering metrics like errors and latencies, to product metrics like clicks and conversions. When you combine metrics with a flag or AI Config change to create a guarded rollout, you can monitor how your flag or AI Config change impacts those metrics.
You can connect metrics to LaunchDarkly using any of the following methods:
 * Use one of our [metrics integrations](/docs/integrations/experimentation)
 * Call the [metric import API](/docs/home/metrics/import-events)
 * Use a LaunchDarkly SDK to [send custom events](/docs/sdk/features/events), and [connect them to metrics](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics)
 * [Enable OpenTelemetry](/docs/sdk/features/opentelemetry-server-side) in a LaunchDarkly SDK and send the OpenTelemetry traces to LaunchDarkly to [autogenerate metrics](/docs/home/metrics/autogen-metrics#metrics-autogenerated-from-opentelemetry-data)
To learn more, read [Metrics](/docs/home/metrics).
## Regressions
When you attach metrics to a flag or AI Config and then start a guarded rollout, LaunchDarkly detects if the change is having a negative impact on your app or audience. This negative effect is called a “regression.” You can configure LaunchDarkly to either notify you of the regression, or notify you of the regression as well as automatically roll back the release.
To learn how to investigate the causes of certain regressions in your guarded rollouts, read [Guarded rollout errors](/docs/home/releases/errors).
