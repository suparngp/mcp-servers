## Overview
This topic explains how to create, edit, and delete applications. An application is a LaunchDarkly resource that describes what you are delivering to a customer.
LaunchDarkly automatically creates applications when it establishes a connection with a LaunchDarkly SDK that contains application information. You can edit and delete applications from the **Applications** list in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI).
## Create applications
LaunchDarkly automatically creates new applications when it establishes a connection with a LaunchDarkly SDK that supports [Application metadata configuration](/docs/sdk/features/app-config).
We strongly recommend also enabling automatic environment attribute collection as part of your SDK configuration. When this configuration is enabled, you can create mobile targeting rules for your feature flag based on the application information. The SDK provides data on the mobile environment where an application is running, including the application name and id. The SDK includes this data in the `ld_application` and `ld_device` contexts. To learn more, read [Automatic environment attributes](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes).
After the SDK has evaluated at least one feature flag using an `ld_application` context, you can create mobile targeting rules based on application and application version information in that context. To learn more, read [Mobile targeting](/docs/home/flags/mobile-targeting).
##### Add mobile targeting rules only after application information is collected
You can only create a “Mobile” targeting rule, and target mobile apps and devices based on automatically collected application information, if you have completed the following:
 * your feature flag has its “Available on mobile SDKs” toggle set to **On**. To learn more, read [Creating new flags](/docs/home/flags/new). LaunchDarkly accounts created after October 21, 2025 have this box checked by default.
 * you have already started to collect application information in the `ld_application` and `ld_device` context kinds. LaunchDarkly must receive these context kinds before it enables the option to create a mobile targeting rule. To learn more, read [Automatic environment attributes](/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes).
## Edit applications
To edit an existing application:
 1. Click the **gear** icon in the left sidenav to view Organization settings.
 2. Click **Applications**.
 3. Find the application you want to edit. Click the **overflow** menu and choose “Edit.”
 4. In the dialog, update the **Kind** , **Description** , or **Maintainer**. You cannot modify the application name or key.
 5. Click **Save**.
