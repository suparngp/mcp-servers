##### Workflows are in maintenance mode
The Workflows feature is in maintenance mode, and is planned for future deprecation at a date not yet specified. We will work with existing customers using workflows to migrate to a replacement solution when deprecation occurs.
## Overview
This topic explains how to create and use workflow templates to automate your rollouts at scale. It describes how to save workflows as templates that can be reused with other flags.
## About workflow templates
If your organization follows a standard procedure for progressive rollout workflows, maintenance window workflows, or other custom workflows, you can turn that workflow into a template so other account members can use it. Workflow templates are saved versions of workflows that you can apply and use with any flags in your account.
##### Progressive rollouts are also a built-in feature of LaunchDarkly
If you are interested in gradually rolling out a particular flag variation to more contexts over a defined period of time, we recommend that you use the separate progressive rollout feature instead of setting up a template for a progressive rollout workflow.
Progressive rollouts are an option on a flag’s targeting rule to serve a given flag variation to a specified percentage of contexts, and gradually increase that percentage over a specified time. They are a built-in feature that supports the most common use case for workflows. We recommend using progressive rollouts instead of workflows or workflow templates if they meet your needs, because progressive rollouts are easier to set up, and because the flag variation that any particular customer encounters changes only once over the course of the rollout. To learn more, read [Progressive rollouts](/docs/home/releases/progressive-rollouts).
### How workflow templates are applied across flags
You can apply workflow templates to any flag in any environment or project, regardless of which environment or project you create them in.
When you apply a template to a different flag or environment from where it was created, any environment or flag specific pieces of the workflow, such as variations, segments, or contexts are cleared. LaunchDarkly prompts you to fill in these blanks with appropriate values for the new flag and environment.
## Save a workflow as a template
Here is how to save a workflow as a template:
 1. Navigate to a feature flag.
 2. Click **Manage workflows** in the right sidebar.
 3. Click **Custom build**.
 4. Build the workflow with the steps that you’d like each flag to follow.
 5. Click **Save as template**.
 6. Give the template a name, a key, and add an optional description. Then click **Next**.
 7. Click **Start workflow** if you would also like to run the workflow on the flag.
## Apply templates to flags
Here is how to apply a template to a flag:
 1. Navigate to a feature flag.
 2. Click **Manage workflows** in the right sidebar.
 3. Click **Existing template**.
 4. Search for the template that you would like to use on the feature flag.
 5. Review the workflow and enter any missing details.
 6. Click **Start workflow** to begin the workflow.
## Delete templates
Templates can only be deleted through the API.
