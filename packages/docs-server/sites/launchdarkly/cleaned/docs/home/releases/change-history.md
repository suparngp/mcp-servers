##### The LaunchDarkly change history used to be called the audit log
The LaunchDarkly change history used to be called the audit log. The [LaunchDarkly REST API](/docs/api/audit-log) still references the audit log.
## Overview
This topic explains how to track changes made in LaunchDarkly. LaunchDarkly keeps a running log of changes made to feature flags and other resources in each environment.
## View the change history
##### The unlimited change history is available to customers on select plans
The unlimited change history is only available to customers on select plans. For Foundation plans, the change history is restricted for account changes to the last 30 days of events, and is otherwise unlimited. For Developer plans, the change history is restricted to the last 30 days of events. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
The change history is a running tally of changes made to feature flags or other resources in a given environment.
To access the change history, click the **clock** icon from any page:
![A portion of the Flags list, with the clock icon highlighted.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/9ff482bc38af8fedd79e084a0f59879d47132f2ccd94cd648518ea96980a57a4/assets/images/auto/change-history-from-flags-list-highlighted.auto.png)
A portion of the Flags list, with the clock icon highlighted.
The “Change history” dialog appears. It is automatically filtered based on the page from which you clicked the **clock** icon. For example, if you click the **clock** icon from the **Flags** list, the change history is filtered to show changes for flags in your current project, in the environments that you have selected on the **Flags** list:
![The "Change history" dialog, automatically filtered by resource, project, and environment.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/fe39c3932a9f24fb03120b0957cf850b133dc96f812d2a9aca23a6ab8423023d/assets/images/auto/change-history-from-flags-list.auto.png)
The "Change history" dialog, automatically filtered by resource, project, and environment.
Click **Expand all details** to view detailed information about each change.
### View a change entry
To view the details of a specific change entry, click on its four-arrow **expand** icon:
![The "link" and "expand" icons for a change entry.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/def2b57524c9f8e3b8821704a1b2107f9aed5a7d1de005e50f14a5f112a184d3/assets/images/auto/change-history-expand.auto.png)
The "link" and "expand" icons for a change entry.
To share a direct link to the change entry, click its **link** icon. A direct link to the change entry is copied to your clipboard.
The detailed change entry lists:
 * the member that made the change
 * the resource affected
 * the environment where the change was made
 * the date of the change
 * a list of the included changes
 * a diff of the changes
![The details of a flag change.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/22de97fa1d5f7628f05b1afe7e35320e62312ece0be3779df5ad5620c70b2491/assets/images/__toPlaywright_newIA/change-history-details.png)

### Filter the change history
To filter the change history, use the “Filter by resource” section.
You can use the “Filter by resource” section to filter the results by any of the following resources:
 * Account
 * AI Config
 * Application
 * Code reference
 * Context kinds
 * Experiment
 * Flag
 * Integration
 * Layer
 * Member
 * Metric
 * Metric group
 * Project
 * Relay Proxy
 * Release pipeline
 * Role
 * Segment
 * Service token
 * Team
 * Template
 * Webhook
You can also filter for changes in particular projects, environments, and actions.
Click the **link** button in the “Filter by resource” section to copy a link to the current change history filter. You can share this with other members in your organization.
### Actions recorded in the change history
In the LaunchDarkly UI, the change history displays a description of each action or set of actions, as entered by the member who performed them. If you use the REST API to review the change history, the API response also includes a list of the specific actions.
The actions displayed vary depending on the resource you’re viewing and your app configuration. To learn more about the actions you may see in the change history, read [Using actions](/docs/home/account/roles/role-actions).
