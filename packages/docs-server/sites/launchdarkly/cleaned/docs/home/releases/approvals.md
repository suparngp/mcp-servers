## Overview
This topic introduces LaunchDarkly’s approvals feature. It explains what approvals are and how to configure them.
## About approvals
When an account member plans a change to a [feature flag](/docs/home/flags/create), [AI Config](/docs/home/ai-configs), or [segment](/docs/home/flags/segments), they have the option to request approval for that change from a member or team in their LaunchDarkly project. Approvals let more people have input on planned changes. These review-style approvals mimic common code review workflows, such as pull request (PR) reviews in GitHub.
Anyone with the `reviewApprovalRequest` [permission](/docs/home/account/roles/role-actions) can approve a change, regardless of whether or not their review has been requested. The LaunchDarkly Project Admin, Maintainer, Developer, and Contributor [project roles](/docs/home/account/roles/project-roles), as well as the Writer, Admin, and Owner base roles, all include this ability. Account members and team members who the requester chooses receive an email notifying them that their review has been requested, and, if applicable, a notification in the LaunchDarkly Slack or Teams app.
## Working with approvals
##### Requiring approvals is available to customers on select plans
Requiring approvals is only available to customers on select plans. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
You can request approval on changes to a flag’s targeting or variations, to an AI Config’s targeting or variations, or to a segment’s targeting, any time after you create it. To learn more, read [Requesting approvals](/docs/home/releases/approval-requests). Enterprise customers can require approval requests for specific environments. To learn more, read [Configuring approvals for an environment](/docs/home/releases/approval-config).
If someone requests your approval on a flag, AI Config, or segment change, the request appears in the **Approvals** dashboard, in your email, and in your in-app inbox. Depending on the approval request, it also appears in the following places:
 * For flags, the approval request appears in the flag’s “Pending changes” panel and, if you use the LaunchDarkly Slack or Microsoft Teams app, in a Slack or Teams notification.
 * For AI Configs, the approval request appears in the AI Configs’s “Pending changes” panel and, if you use the LaunchDarkly Slack app, in a Slack notification.
 * For segments, the approval request appears in the segment’s details page and, if you use the LaunchDarkly Slack app, in a Slack notification.
To learn more, read [Reviewing approval requests](/docs/home/releases/approval-reviews).
##### AI Config and segment approvals do not appear in Microsoft Teams
If someone requests your approval on a flag change and you use the LaunchDarkly Slack or Microsoft Teams app, you will receive a Slack or Teams notification. AI Config and segment approvals are also sent through Slack, but are not sent through Microsoft Teams.
To learn how to customize approval request settings, read [Approval request settings](/docs/home/releases/approvals-settings).
