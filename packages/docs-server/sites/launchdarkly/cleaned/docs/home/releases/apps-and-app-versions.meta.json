  "description": "This topic explains what applications and application versions are and how to use them. An application is a LaunchDarkly resource that describes what you are delivering to a customer. LaunchDarkly automatically creates applications when it establishes a connection with a LaunchDarkly SDK that contains application information. After an application is created, you can build flag targeting rules based on application name, version, or other properties, such as whether or not a particular application version is supported."
