## Overview
This category explains how to use LaunchDarkly to manage your AI Configs. An AI Config is a resource that you create in LaunchDarkly. You can use AI Configs to customize, test, and roll out new large language models (LLMs) within your generative AI applications.
AI Configs can be created in two modes:
 * Prompt-based: Use messages and roles to configure prompts for single-step completions. To learn more, read [Create and manage AI Config variations](/docs/home/ai-configs/create-variation).
 * Agent-based: Use instructions and tools to configure multi-step workflows. To learn more, read [Agents in AI Configs](/docs/home/ai-configs/agents).
With AI Configs, you can:
 * Manage your model configuration outside of your application code. This means you can update model details and messages at runtime, without deploying changes. Teammates who have LaunchDarkly access but no codebase familiarity can collaborate and iterate on messages.
 * Upgrade your app to the latest model version as soon as it’s available, then roll out the change gradually and safely.
 * Add a configuration for a new model provider and progressively shift production traffic to that provider.
 * Compare variations to determine which performs better based on satisfaction, cost, or other metrics. You can compare messages across models or compare the same model across providers.
 * Run experiments to measure the impact of generative AI features in your application.
AI Configs also support advanced use cases such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and evaluation in production. You can:
 * Track which knowledge base or vector index is active for a given model or audience.
 * Experiment with different chunking strategies, retrieval sources, or prompt structures.
 * Evaluate outputs using side-by-side comparisons or AI Config-as-judge methods implemented in your application.
 * Build guardrail logic into your runtime configs, such as models, prompts, and filters, and use targeting rules to block risky generations or switch to fallback behavior.
 * Apply different safety filters by user type, geography, or application context.
 * Use live metrics for satisfaction, factuality, and hallucination detection to guide rollouts.
These capabilities let you build safety controls, run targeted experiments, and evaluate model behavior in production without being locked into a single model provider or manual workflow.
## How AI Configs work
Every AI Config contains one or more variations. Each variation includes a model configuration and, optionally, one or more messages. You can also define targeting rules, just like you do with feature flags, to make sure that particular messages and model configurations are served to particular end users of your application.
Then, within your application, you use one of LaunchDarkly’s [AI SDKs](/docs/sdk/ai). The SDK determines which messages and model your application should serve to which contexts. The SDK can also customize the messages based on context attributes and other variables that you provide. This means both the messages and the model evaluation are modified to be specific to each end user at runtime. You can update your messages, specific to each end user, without redeploying your application.
After you use this customized config in your AI model generation, you can use the SDK to record various metrics, including generation count, tokens, and satisfaction rate. These appear in the LaunchDarkly user interface for each AI Config variation.
The topics in this category explain how to create AI Configs and variations, update targeting rules, monitor related metrics, and incorporate AI Configs in your application.
