## Overview
This topic explains what metric groups are and when to use them. A metric group is a reusable list of metrics you can use to standardize metrics across multiple flags or experiments.
For example, if you have a standard user sign-up flow, you could create four metrics that track customers clicking the sign up button, entering their personal information, adding payment information, and clicking the submit button. By combining these four metrics into a funnel metric group, you can then attach that group to all of your sign-up funnel experiments, ensuring you’re tracking the correct metrics for each step within each funnel.
You can view your metric groups from the **Metrics** list on the **Metric groups** tab:

To learn how to create and manage metric groups, read [Creating and managing metric groups](/docs/home/metrics/metric-groups-manage).
## Metric group types
There are two types of metric groups: funnel metric groups and standard metric groups.
### Funnel metric groups
Funnel metric groups are for use with funnel optimization experiments. A “funnel” is a marketing model that describes a customer’s journey through your purchasing or conversion cycle, typically from the awareness stage to the purchasing stage. LaunchDarkly’s funnel optimization experiments use multiple metrics to track the performance of each of the steps in your funnel over time.
The order of metrics in a funnel metric group determines how LaunchDarkly analyzes end-user behavior. LaunchDarkly only evaluates a step if the end user has triggered the first step in the funnel. Each metric should represent a required action in the intended sequence of the end user journey. If end users skip a step or complete steps out of order, the results may be incomplete or misleading and will skew your experiment results.
When you create a funnel metric group, each metric should measure a required step in the user journey. Customers should not be able to skip any steps the funnel group is measuring, or take any steps out of order. Doing so will skew your experiment results.
To include a metric in a funnel metric group, the metric must:
 * have a [custom conversion binary](/docs/home/metrics/custom), [clicked or tapped](/docs/home/metrics/click), or [page viewed](/docs/home/metrics/pageview) type
 * use the “Occurrence” measurement method
You cannot include [custom numeric metrics](/docs/home/metrics/custom-numeric) or [custom conversion count metrics](/docs/home/metrics/custom-count) in a funnel metric group, and you cannot include any metrics that use the “Count” or “Value/size” measurement method in a funnel metric group.
To learn more, read [Creating funnel experiments](/docs/home/experimentation/funnel).
You cannot use funnel metric groups in [feature change experiments](/docs/home/experimentation/types#feature-change-experiments). Instead, use a standard metric group.
### Standard metric groups
Standard metric groups are for use with feature change experiments and guarded rollouts. Metrics in standard metric groups can appear in any order. To learn more, read [Creating feature change experiments](/docs/home/experimentation/feature) and [Guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts).

## View a metric group
To view a metric group’s details page, click on the metric group’s name from the **Metric groups** list. The metric group details page displays all of the metrics in the group.
The “Metric group connections” section includes information on any experiments or flags the metric group is connected to:
