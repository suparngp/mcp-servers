  "description": "This topic explains how to import metric events from your existing data pipeline for use with [Experimentation](/docs/home/experimentation) and [guarded rollouts](/docs/home/releases/guarded-rollouts). Using the metric import REST API described below, you can send your already-instrumented metrics into LaunchDarkly without writing and deploying new code for each metric."
