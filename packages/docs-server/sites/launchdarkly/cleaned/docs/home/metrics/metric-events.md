## Overview
This topic explains the different metric event types and which SDKs they are compatible with.
An “event” happens when an end user takes an action in your app, such as clicking on a button, or when a system takes an action, such as loading a page. Your SDKs send these events to LaunchDarkly, where LaunchDarkly metrics can aggregate and analyze them. LaunchDarkly can then quantify the overall performance and health of your product and provide suggestions on how to respond.
## Types of metric events
There are three types of metric events:
 * `custom` events are produced by [custom conversion binary](/docs/home/metrics/custom), [custom conversion count](/docs/home/metrics/custom-count), and [custom numeric metrics](/docs/home/metrics/custom-numeric). You can send `custom` events using the [track feature in your SDK](/docs/sdk/features/events).
 * Conversion metrics register events when an end user takes an action based on a feature flag they encounter.
 * Numeric metrics measure numeric values against a baseline you set.
 * `click` events are produced by [clicked or tapped metrics](/docs/home/metrics/click).
 * `page view` events are produced by [page viewed metrics](/docs/home/metrics/pageview).
To learn more about event kinds, read [Event kinds](/docs/integrations/data-export/schema-reference#event-kinds). To learn more about Experimentation events, read [Experimentation and metric events](/docs/home/experimentation/events).

## SDK compatibility
The following table explains the kinds of events you can track with a metric and their SDK compatibility:
Event kind | Metric | Description | SDK compatibility 
---|---|---|--- 
Custom | Conversion binary | Tracks events for any arbitrary event. | All 
Custom | Conversion count | Counts events for any arbitrary event. | All 
Custom | Numeric | Tracks increases or decreases in numeric value against a baseline you set. | All 
Clicked or tapped | Conversion | Tracks the clicks on a user interface (UI) element. | Electron 
JavaScript 
Node.js (client-side) 
React Web 
Vue 
Page viewed | Conversion | Tracks how many times a page is viewed. | Electron 
JavaScript 
Node.js (client-side) 
React Web 
Vue 
To learn more about different metric types and when to use them, read [Choose a metric type](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics#choose-a-metric-type).
For examples of common metrics and how to configure them, read [Example metrics](/docs/guides/metrics/example-metrics).
## Metric event activity
The metric event **Activity** tab provides visibility into the events LaunchDarkly is receiving for a given metric.
LaunchDarkly stores the most recent matching event, and the last 100 events received within two hours of that event. This helps you determine whether the metric is actively receiving data.
##### Event processing for archived metrics
Archived metrics continue to receive and process matching events. However, LaunchDarkly hides archived metrics from dashboards, experiment setup screens, and metric selection menus by default.
For each event, the **Activity** tab displays:
 * Timestamp: when the metric received the event.
 * Context key: the key of the context that generated the event.
 * Value: for custom numeric metrics, the numeric value of the event.
To view more information about a specific event, click on the event row. An “Event details” dialog appears:
![Details for a metric event.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/dfffe7badc62219ad90fa7032ceabf36321c9cc82dae4ae12f953829e3bd9aa8/assets/images/__LD_UI_no_test/metric-event-details.png)
Details for a metric event.
To learn how to view a list of all of the metric events your SDKs are sending to LaunchDarkly, read [Viewing incoming events](/docs/home/metrics/view-incoming-events).
## Filtering event data for analysis
All events that match a metric’s event key are ingested and visible in the **Activity** tab, regardless of whether or not the metric includes filtering.
If you want to include only a subset of these events in your analysis, you can apply filters to the metric itself. This affects only which events LaunchDarkly uses in impact calculations. Filters do not affect event ingestion or what displays on the **Activity** tab.
To learn more, read [Filtering custom metric events](/docs/home/metrics/event-filters).
## Event keys
##### Event keys and metric keys are different
Sending custom events to LaunchDarkly requires a unique **event key**. You can set the event key to anything you want. Adding this event key to your codebase lets your SDK track actions customers take in your app as events. To learn more, read [Sending custom events](/docs/sdk/features/events).
LaunchDarkly also automatically generates a **metric key** when you create a metric. You only use the metric key to identify the metric in API calls. To learn more, read [Creating and managing metrics](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics).
LaunchDarkly SDKs track actions customers take in your app as events and sends them to LaunchDarkly. Events are specific to one LaunchDarkly environment.
An event key is a unique identifier you set for a particular kind of event within your app. You can set an event key to anything you want. When you are using metrics, the event key in your metric and the event key in your code must match exactly. To learn more, read [Sending custom events](/docs/sdk/features/events).
