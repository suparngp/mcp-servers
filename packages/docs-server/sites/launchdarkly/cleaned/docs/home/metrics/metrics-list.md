## Overview
This topic explains how to view, search, and filter metrics in LaunchDarkly. The **Metrics** list is the central location for reviewing and managing all metrics in a project. From this list, you can find metrics by name, tag, maintainer, or type, and understand how they connect to experiments, guarded rollouts, and metric groups.
![The Metrics list.](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://launchdarkly.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/ed14f0ff2b68e1a8f4981fab433efaa56bfbc85100ee8b068338f5e0cf2ff54f/assets/images/auto/metric-list.auto.png)
The Metrics list.
Open the metrics list from the left navigation under **Metrics**.
## Search and browse metrics
The metrics list displays all metrics defined in the selected project and environment. Each row includes:
 * Name and description
 * Type, such as `Custom numeric` or `Clicked or tapped`
 * Maintainer
 * Tags
 * Connections to experiments, guarded rollouts, and metric groups
Use the search bar to find a metric by name or description. Select a metric name to open its details page and review its configuration, activity, and connections.
To learn more about metric details, read [Creating and managing metrics](/docs/home/metrics/create-metrics).
## Filter and sort the list
Select **Filters** at the top of the list to narrow the view by any of the following attributes:
 * Tags
 * Maintainer
 * Metric type
 * Connections to experiments or guarded rollouts
You can apply more than one filter at a time. The filter bar remains visible while you browse so you can adjust filters without leaving the list.
You can also sort the list by:
 * Metric age, newest or oldest
 * Name, A–Z or Z–A
 * Number of connections to experiments or guarded rollouts
Filtering and sorting help you focus on the metrics most relevant to your current work.
## Tabs in the metrics section
The metrics section includes several tabs for viewing related resources:
 * **Metrics** : the default list of individual metrics
 * **Metric groups** : reusable collections of metrics that standardize measurement across teams. To learn more, read [Metric groups](/docs/home/metrics/metric-groups)
 * **Connections** : a summary of how metrics are linked to experiments, guarded rollouts, and other LaunchDarkly features
Use the tabs to switch between metrics, metric groups, and connections without leaving the metrics section.
## Filter metrics and filter the metrics list
Filtering the Metrics list and filtering an individual metric are different:
 * Filtering the metrics list changes which metrics appear in the UI. It helps you find and organize metrics, but does not affect data collection or analysis.
 * Filtering a metric limits which events LaunchDarkly includes when it calculates results. For example, you can restrict a metric to events where `country = "CA"` or `plan = "enterprise"`.
To learn how to apply filters to a metric’s event data, read [Filtering custom metric events](/docs/home/metrics/event-filters).

 * [Analyze metric definitions and results](/docs/home/metrics/metric-analysis)
 * [Group related metrics for reuse](/docs/home/metrics/metric-groups)
