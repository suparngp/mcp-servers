##### Project roles provided by LaunchDarkly are available for early access
Project roles provided by LaunchDarkly may be available in your account as part of our Early Access Program (EAP). If these roles are available, a banner appears on the **Roles** page prompting you to add the roles to your account. After you add these roles, you can assign them to any member. These roles all have names that start with “LaunchDarkly.”
To request access these provided roles, request to join the EAP.
## Overview
This topic explains how to start using preset roles. Preset roles let you onboard new members quickly without having to build custom roles from scratch. These roles streamline permission management by grouping common sets of permissions applicable to different team members.
Preset roles facilitate the efficient onboarding of new team members by letting you quickly assign standardized permissions. They reduce complexity by letting you avoid manually creating complex permission sets. They also provide consistency and security by applying standardized permissions across projects and your entire account.
Preset roles use role attributes, which are parameters for the role’s scope. Members with appropriate permissions can expand permissions to these pre-built roles to meet specific organizational requirements. To learn more, read [Using role scope](/docs/home/account/roles/role-scope).
LaunchDarkly’s base roles (Reader, Writer, Admin, Owner, No access) still exist. Customers with access to preset roles may continue to use base roles when assigning permissions to any member. To learn more, read [Roles](/docs/home/account/roles).
## Preset role categories
There are different types of preset roles: project roles and organization roles. Project roles are scoped to individual projects, while organization roles apply across your entire account.
### Project roles
 * **LaunchDarkly Contributor** : Can update flag statuses and perform releases. Cannot create or delete flags.
 * **LaunchDarkly Developer** : Can take any actions on flags that are within projects or views assigned to that team member
 * **LaunchDarkly Maintainer** : Can manage resources grouping flags, such as projects and views
 * **LaunchDarkly Project Admin** : Can perform all project-level actions
 * **LaunchDarkly Viewer** : Can only read project data. Cannot take any actions.
To learn more, read [Project roles](/docs/home/account/roles/project-roles).
### Organization roles
 * **LaunchDarkly Billing Admin** : Can manage billing and payment details
 * **LaunchDarkly Admin** : Can control administrative settings and manage projects and team memberships. Cannot take actions on billing or payment details.
 * **LaunchDarkly Architect** : Manages flags and top-level resources across all projects. Cannot take account-level actions.
 * **LaunchDarkly Member** : Default role with no permissions, unless assigned additional project roles.
To learn more, read [Organization roles](/docs/home/account/roles/organization-roles).
