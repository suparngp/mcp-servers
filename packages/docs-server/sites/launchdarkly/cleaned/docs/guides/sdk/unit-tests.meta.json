  "description": "This guide explains how to unit test LaunchDarkly React applications with Jest. [jest-launchdarkly-mock](https://github.com/launchdarkly/jest-launchdarkly-mock) allows you to simulate, or “mock,” flag evaluations locally. This lets you verify testing behavior happens correctly, while also letting you use the React SDK in your React application."
