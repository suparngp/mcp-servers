# Flagship, an engineering blog
### Ideas, patterns, and stories from the people building the future of feature management
At LaunchDarkly, we believe software engineering is a discipline of structured creativity. Flagship is our space to share how we design, develop, and scale technology to help teams deliver better software, faster. From architectural decisions to cultural practices, these are the stories that shape our platform and our craft.
