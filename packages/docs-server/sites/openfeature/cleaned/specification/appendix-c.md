OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol (OFREP) is a unified feature flag evaluation protocol that adheres to the OpenFeature semantics. You can find proposals, discussions and the progress at the dedicated [OpenFeature OFREP](https://github.com/open-feature/protocol) repository.
There is a dedicated [OpenFeature working group](https://github.com/open-feature/community/blob/main/config/open-feature/spec-evaluation/workgroup.yaml) for this initiative that focuses on:
 * Feature flag evaluation protocol
 * Telemetry enrichment of the evaluations
 * Reference implementations of the protocol
If you are interested in this initiative, you can join the [`#openfeature-remote-evaluation-protocol`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C066A48LK35) Slack channel on the [CNCF Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-native/cncf) workspace.
