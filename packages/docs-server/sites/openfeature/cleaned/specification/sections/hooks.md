## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")
`Hooks` are a mechanism whereby application developers can add arbitrary behavior to flag evaluation. They operate similarly to middleware in many web frameworks.
Hooks add their logic at any of four specific stages of flag evaluation:
 * `before`, immediately before flag evaluation
 * `after`, immediately after successful flag evaluation
 * `error`, immediately after an unsuccessful flag evaluation
 * `finally`, unconditionally after flag evaluation
Hooks can be configured to run globally (impacting all flag evaluations), per client, or per flag evaluation invocation. Some example use cases for a hook include adding additional data to the [evaluation context](/specification/sections/evaluation-context), performing validation on the received flag value, providing data to telemetric tools, and logging errors.
### Definitions[​](#definitions "Direct link to Definitions")
**Hook** : Application author/integrator-supplied logic that is called by the OpenFeature framework at a specific stage.
**Stage** : An explicit portion of the flag evaluation lifecycle. e.g. `before` being "before the [resolution](/specification/glossary#resolving-flag-values) is run.
**Invocation** : A single call to evaluate a flag. `client.getBooleanValue(..)` is an invocation.
**API** : The global API singleton.
### 4.1. Hook context[​](#41-hook-context "Direct link to 4.1. Hook context")
Hook context exists to provide hooks with information about the invocation and propagate data between hook stages.
#### Requirement 4.1.1[​](#requirement-411 "Direct link to Requirement 4.1.1")
> Hook context **MUST** provide: the `flag key`, `flag value type`, `evaluation context`, `default value`, and `hook data`.
The `evaluation context` provided in the hook context refers to the **merged evaluation context** as specified in [Requirement 3.2.3](/specification/sections/evaluation-context#requirement-323).
#### Requirement 4.1.2[​](#requirement-412 "Direct link to Requirement 4.1.2")
> The `hook context` **SHOULD** provide access to the `client metadata` and the `provider metadata` fields.
#### Requirement 4.1.3[​](#requirement-413 "Direct link to Requirement 4.1.3")
> The `flag key`, `flag type`, and `default value` properties **MUST** be immutable. If the language does not support immutability, the hook **MUST NOT** modify these properties.
#### Condition 4.1.4[​](#condition-414 "Direct link to Condition 4.1.4")
> The implementation uses the dynamic-context paradigm.
see: [dynamic-context paradigm](/specification/glossary#dynamic-context-paradigm)
##### Conditional Requirement 4.1.4.1[​](#conditional-requirement-4141 "Direct link to Conditional Requirement 4.1.4.1")
> The evaluation context **MUST** be mutable only within the `before` hook.
#### Requirement 4.1.5[​](#requirement-415 "Direct link to Requirement 4.1.5")
> The `hook data` **MUST** be mutable.
Either the `hook data` reference itself must be mutable, or it must allow mutation of its contents.
Mutable reference:
```
hookContext.hookData={'my-key':'my-value'} 
```
Mutable content:
```
hookContext.hookData.set('my-key','my-value') 
```
### 4.2. Hook Hints[​](#42-hook-hints "Direct link to 4.2. Hook Hints")
#### Requirement 4.2.1[​](#requirement-421 "Direct link to Requirement 4.2.1")
> `hook hints` **MUST** be a structure supports definition of arbitrary properties, with keys of type `string`, and values of type `boolean | string | number | datetime | structure`.
#### Condition 4.2.2[​](#condition-422 "Direct link to Condition 4.2.2")
> The implementation language supports a mechanism for marking data as immutable.
##### Conditional Requirement 4.2.2.1[​](#conditional-requirement-4221 "Direct link to Conditional Requirement 4.2.2.1")
> Condition: `Hook hints` **MUST** be immutable.
##### Conditional Requirement 4.2.2.2[​](#conditional-requirement-4222 "Direct link to Conditional Requirement 4.2.2.2")
> Condition: The client `metadata` field in the `hook context` **MUST** be immutable.
##### Conditional Requirement 4.2.2.3[​](#conditional-requirement-4223 "Direct link to Conditional Requirement 4.2.2.3")
> Condition: The provider `metadata` field in the `hook context` **MUST** be immutable.
### 4.3. Hook creation and parameters[​](#43-hook-creation-and-parameters "Direct link to 4.3. Hook creation and parameters")
#### Requirement 4.3.1[​](#requirement-431 "Direct link to Requirement 4.3.1")
> Hooks **MUST** specify at least one stage.
#### Requirement 4.3.2[​](#requirement-432 "Direct link to Requirement 4.3.2")
> `Hook data` **MUST** must be created before the first `stage` invoked in a hook for a specific evaluation and propagated between each `stage` of the hook. The hook data is not shared between different hooks.
Example showing data between `before` and `after` stage for two different hooks.
#### Condition 4.3.2[​](#condition-432 "Direct link to Condition 4.3.2")
> The implementation uses the dynamic-context paradigm.
see: [dynamic-context paradigm](/specification/glossary#dynamic-context-paradigm)
##### Conditional Requirement 4.3.2.1[​](#conditional-requirement-4321 "Direct link to Conditional Requirement 4.3.2.1")
> The `before` stage **MUST** run before flag resolution occurs. It accepts a `hook context` (required) and `hook hints` (optional) as parameters and returns either an `evaluation context` or nothing.
```
EvaluationContext|voidbefore(HookContext hookContext,HookHints hints); 
```
#### Condition 4.3.3[​](#condition-433 "Direct link to Condition 4.3.3")
[![hardening](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=hardening&color=yellow)](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/tree/main/specification#hardening)
> The implementation uses the static-context paradigm.
see: [static-context paradigm](/specification/glossary#static-context-paradigm)
##### Conditional Requirement 4.3.3.1[​](#conditional-requirement-4331 "Direct link to Conditional Requirement 4.3.3.1")
> The `before` stage **MUST** run before flag resolution occurs. It accepts a `hook context` (required) and `hook hints` (optional) as parameters. It has no return value.
```
voidbefore(HookContext hookContext,HookHints hints); 
```
#### Requirement 4.3.4[​](#requirement-434 "Direct link to Requirement 4.3.4")
> Any `evaluation context` returned from a `before` hook **MUST** be passed to subsequent `before` hooks (via `HookContext`).
#### Requirement 4.3.5[​](#requirement-435 "Direct link to Requirement 4.3.5")
> When `before` hooks have finished executing, any resulting `evaluation context` **MUST** be merged with the existing `evaluation context`.
Evaluation context merge order is defined in [Context levels and merging](/specification/sections/evaluation-context#32-context-levels-and-merging).
#### Requirement 4.3.6[​](#requirement-436 "Direct link to Requirement 4.3.6")
> The `after` stage **MUST** run after flag resolution occurs. It accepts a `hook context` (required), `evaluation details` (required) and `hook hints` (optional). It has no return value.
#### Requirement 4.3.7[​](#requirement-437 "Direct link to Requirement 4.3.7")
> The `error` hook **MUST** run when errors are encountered in the `before` stage, the `after` stage or during flag resolution. It accepts `hook context` (required), `exception` representing what went wrong (required), and `hook hints` (optional). It has no return value.
#### Requirement 4.3.8[​](#requirement-438 "Direct link to Requirement 4.3.8")
> The `finally` hook **MUST** run after the `before`, `after`, and `error` stages. It accepts a `hook context` (required), `evaluation details` (required) and `hook hints` (optional). It has no return value.
The evaluation details passed to the `finally` stage matches the evaluation details returned to the application author.
#### Condition 4.3.9[​](#condition-439 "Direct link to Condition 4.3.9")
> `finally` is a reserved word in the language.
##### Conditional Requirement 4.3.9.1[​](#conditional-requirement-4391 "Direct link to Conditional Requirement 4.3.9.1")
> Instead of `finally`, `finallyAfter` **SHOULD** be used.
### 4.4. Hook registration & ordering[​](#44-hook-registration--ordering "Direct link to 4.4. Hook registration & ordering")
#### Requirement 4.4.1[​](#requirement-441 "Direct link to Requirement 4.4.1")
> The API, Client, Provider, and invocation **MUST** have a method for registering hooks.
```
OpenFeature.addHooks(newHook1()); 
//... 
Client client =OpenFeature.getClient(); 
client.addHooks(newHook2()); 
` 
//... 
client.getValue('my-flag','defaultValue',newHook3()); 
```
#### Requirement 4.4.2[​](#requirement-442 "Direct link to Requirement 4.4.2")
> Hooks **MUST** be executed "stack-wise" with respect to flag resolution, prioritizing increasing specificity (API, Client, Invocation, Provider) first, and the order in which they were added second.
Before flag resolution (the `before` stage), hooks run in the order `API` -> `Client` -> `Invocation` -> `Provider`, and within those, in the order in which they were added. After flag evaluation (the `after`, `error`, or `finally` stages), hooks run in the order `Provider` -> `Invocation` -> `Client` -> `API`, and within those, in reverse of the order in which they were added. This achieves intuitive "stack-like" or "LIFO" behavior for side effects and transformations.
Given hooks A - H, each implementing the both the `before` and `after` stages, added at the following levels and order:
 * API: [A, B]
 * Client: [C, D]
 * Invocation: [E, F]
 * Provider: [G, H]
The expected order of execution is:
#### Requirement 4.4.3[​](#requirement-443 "Direct link to Requirement 4.4.3")
> If a `finally` hook abnormally terminates, evaluation **MUST** proceed, including the execution of any remaining `finally` hooks.
In languages with try/catch semantics, this means that exceptions thrown in `finally` hooks should be caught and not propagated up the call stack.
#### Requirement 4.4.4[​](#requirement-444 "Direct link to Requirement 4.4.4")
> If an `error` hook abnormally terminates, evaluation **MUST** proceed, including the execution of any remaining `error` hooks.
In languages with try/catch semantics, this means that exceptions thrown in `error` hooks should be caught, and not propagated up the call stack.
#### Requirement 4.4.5[​](#requirement-445 "Direct link to Requirement 4.4.5")
> If an error occurs in the `before` or `after` hooks, the `error` hooks **MUST** be invoked.
#### Requirement 4.4.6[​](#requirement-446 "Direct link to Requirement 4.4.6")
> If an error occurs during the evaluation of `before` or `after` hooks, any remaining hooks in the `before` or `after` stages **MUST NOT** be invoked.
#### Requirement 4.4.7[​](#requirement-447 "Direct link to Requirement 4.4.7")
> If an error occurs in the `before` hooks, the default value **MUST** be returned.
Before hooks can impact evaluation by various means, such as mutating the `evaluation context`. Therefore, an error in the `before` hooks is considered abnormal execution, and the default should be returned.
### [Flag evaluation options](/specification/types#evaluation-options)[​](#flag-evaluation-options "Direct link to flag-evaluation-options")
Usage might look something like:
```
val = client.get_boolean_value('my-key',False, evaluation_options={ 
'hooks': new MyHook(), 
'hook_hints':{'side-item':'onion rings'} 
}) 
```
see: [Flag evaluation options](/specification/sections/flag-evaluation#evaluation-options)
#### Requirement 4.5.1[​](#requirement-451 "Direct link to Requirement 4.5.1")
> `Flag evaluation options` **MAY** contain `hook hints`, a map of data to be provided to hook invocations.
#### Requirement 4.5.2[​](#requirement-452 "Direct link to Requirement 4.5.2")
> `hook hints` **MUST** be passed to each hook.
#### Requirement 4.5.3[​](#requirement-453 "Direct link to Requirement 4.5.3")
> The hook **MUST NOT** alter the `hook hints` structure.
### 4.6. Hook data[​](#46-hook-data "Direct link to 4.6. Hook data")
Hook data exists to allow hook stages to share data for a specific evaluation. For instance a span for OpenTelemetry could be created in a `before` stage and closed in an `after` stage.
Hook data is scoped to a specific hook instance. The different stages of a hook share the same data, but different hooks have different hook data instances.
```
publicOptional<EvaluationContext>before(HookContext context,HookHints hints){ 
SpanBuilder builder = tracer.spanBuilder('sample') 
.setParent(Context.current().with(Span.current())); 
Span span = builder.startSpan() 
 context.hookData.set("span", span); 
} 
publicvoidafter(HookContext context,FlagEvaluationDetails details,HookHints hints){ 
// Only accessible by this hook for this specific evaluation. 
Object value = context.hookData.get("span"); 
if(value instanceofSpan){ 
Span span =(Span) value; 
 span.end(); 
} 
} 
```
#### Requirement 4.6.1[​](#requirement-461 "Direct link to Requirement 4.6.1")
> `hook data` **MUST** be a structure supporting the definition of arbitrary properties, with keys of type `string`, and values of any type.
Access to hook data is restricted to only a single hook instance, and it has no serialization requirements, and as a result does not require any value type restrictions.
Example TypeScript definition:
```
type HookData=Record<string, unknown>;
