  "description": "`Events` allow consumers (_application integrator_ , _application author_ , _integration author_) to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes, provider readiness, or error conditions. A provider may emit events or run a callback indicating that it received a certain event, optionally providing data associated with that event. Handlers registered on the `client` or the global `API` are then invoked with this data."
