## Connect your AI applications to the world
AI-enabled tools are powerful, but they’re often limited to the information you manually provide or require bespoke integrations.
Whether it’s reading files from your computer, searching through an internal or external knowledge base, or updating tasks in an project management tool, MCP provides a secure, standardized, _simple_ way to give AI systems the context they need.
## How it works
1
### Choose MCP servers
Pick from pre-built servers for popular tools like GitHub, Google Drive, Slack and hundreds of others. Combine multiple servers for complete workflows, or easily build your own for custom integrations.
2
### Connect your AI application
Configure your AI application (like Claude, VS Code, or ChatGPT) to connect to your MCP servers. The application can now see available tools, resources and prompts from all connected servers.
3
### Work with context
Your AI-powered application can now access real data, execute actions, and provide more helpful responses based on your actual context.
