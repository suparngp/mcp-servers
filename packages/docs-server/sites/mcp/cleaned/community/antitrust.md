Introduction
The goal of the Model Context Protocol open source project (the “Project”) is to develop a universal standard for model-to-world interactions, including enabling LLMs and agents to seamlessly connect with and utilize external data sources and tools. The purpose of this Antitrust Policy (the “Policy”) is to avoid antitrust risks in carrying out this pro-competitive mission. Participants in and contributors to the Project (collectively, “participants”) will use their best reasonable efforts to comply in all respects with all applicable state and federal antitrust and trade regulation laws, and applicable antitrust/competition laws of other countries (collectively, the “Antitrust Laws”). The goal of Antitrust Laws is to encourage vigorous competition. Nothing in this Policy prohibits or limits the ability of participants to make, sell or use any product, or otherwise to compete in the marketplace. This Policy provides general guidance on compliance with Antitrust Law. Participants should contact their respective legal counsel to address specific questions. This Policy is conservative and is intended to promote compliance with the Antitrust Laws, not to create duties or obligations beyond what the Antitrust Laws actually require. In the event of any inconsistency between this Policy and the Antitrust Laws, the Antitrust Laws preempt and control.

Conduct of Meetings
At meetings among actual or potential competitors, there is a risk that participants in those meetings may improperly disclose or discuss information in violation of the Antitrust Laws or otherwise act in an anti-competitive manner. To avoid this risk, participants must adhere to the following policies when participating in Project-related or sponsored meetings, conference calls, or other forums (collectively, “Project Meetings”). Participants must not, in fact or appearance, discuss or exchange information regarding:
 * An individual company’s current or projected prices, price changes, price differentials, markups, discounts, allowances, terms and conditions of sale, including credit terms, etc., or data that bear on prices, including profits, margins or cost.
 * Industry-wide pricing policies, price levels, price changes, differentials, or the like.
 * Actual or projected changes in industry production, capacity or inventories.
 * Matters relating to bids or intentions to bid for particular products, procedures for responding to bid invitations or specific contractual arrangements.
 * Plans of individual companies concerning the design, characteristics, production, distribution, marketing or introduction dates of particular products, including proposed territories or customers.
 * Matters relating to actual or potential individual suppliers that might have the effect of excluding them from any market or of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such suppliers.
 * Matters relating to actual or potential customers that might have the effect of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such customers.
 * Individual company current or projected cost of procurement, development or manufacture of any product.
 * Individual company market shares for any product or for all products.
 * Confidential or otherwise sensitive business plans or strategy.
In connection with all Project Meetings, participants must do the following:
 * Adhere to prepared agendas.
 * Insist that meeting minutes be prepared and distributed to all participants, and that meeting minutes accurately reflect the matters that transpired.
 * Consult with their respective counsel on all antitrust questions related to Project Meetings.
 * Protest against any discussions that appear to violate these policies or the Antitrust Laws, leave any meeting in which such discussions continue, and either insist that such protest be noted in the minutes.

Requirements/Standard Setting
The Project may establish standards, technical requirements and/or specifications for use (collectively, “requirements”). Participants shall not enter into agreements that prohibit or restrict any participant from establishing or adopting any other requirements. Participants shall not undertake any efforts, directly or indirectly, to prevent any firm from manufacturing, selling, or supplying any product not conforming to a requirement. The Project shall not promote standardization of commercial terms, such as terms for license and sale.
